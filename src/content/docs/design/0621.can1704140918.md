dollars worth of value 


everytime i started getting control 
she goes off the rails

where does it all fit in

yo have to start broadcasting soon

alygotrythm to condense a sentence down to a single idea 

what other language tools exist
why do we need language tools
because we want to use them to create a giantatic story
these are triggered by the interaction with people

you need locations 


do you feel the slow march to destruction



the system that controls interactions with the characters
interactions happen when characters go to certain locations 


pain in my chest yesterday
so much pain 
i did not feel as if i would live to see fourty
the heart with its paper thin walls would bust
the look on the eyes of papa when i mentioned this 
too much to bear
slow down
stop spending time with them

i need you to create a program
this program looks through all classics 
it out put files 

we are not going to write the dialog 
we will use code to change the dialog to suit our story

i need books split into chapter files 
at the top of the chapter is a list of all the dialoge
below is a list of all the verb 
if we could only figure out how to get the machine 
to give us a synopsis

then once we have all the dialouge 
we try to create new dialoge to fit newer situations 

then we assign our characters with their characters




yung-wang-coo: You are welcome, sir, most welcome
yung-wang-coo: now, then, lizard skull  will you be quiet 
yung-wang-coo: pray don’t heed him, sir!— the gator usually bites not barks. I
yung-wang-coo: make no doubt a glass of water and a dose of globratchet would be acceptable this dreadfully
hot day

{notice garments }

yung-wang-coo: A thousand pardons!
I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor
roof. What would the abbé please to have? What refreshment can I offer?
All I have is at his service

(priest gaze) 

The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching
gaze—there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar
scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the
countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at
his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed
it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking
with a strong Italian accent, “You are, I presume, M. Caderousse?”

“Yes, sir,” answered the host, even more surprised at the question than
he had been by the silence which had preceded it; “I am Gaspard
Caderousse, at your service.”
