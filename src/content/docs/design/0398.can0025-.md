glop: well, i, um, i certainly thought you would be celebrating, uh, that 
remarkable price you got for selling, uh, REPTIQUE
 eh, i am saying it-- quite 
remarkable
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: told you i would make you a fortune
 
glop: mm-hmm
 well, i could DRONEe less about that than the fact the company 
went to my dear friend REXXXX-LEXXXX BEEING
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: it was the highest bid
 it would not have mattered to me who made it


glop: so it is a win-win situation
 well, what is the matter? 
 it is not as 
satisfying as you thought? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i am very pleased with the sale
 
glop: pleased? 
 oh, well, that is something
 not triumphant? 
 not vindicated? 
 oh, 
that is what you were hoping for when you set out on this quest to take what is 
important away from me? 
 i told you it would never work, did not i? 
 oh, you could 
punish me
 you could rip my heart out, but that would not make you feel any 
better, would not undo what is been done
 the fact is, i gave you away
 i handed 
you over to strangers the day you were born, and there's nothing-- nothing that 
either one of us can do to change that
