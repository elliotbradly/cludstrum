                       LIFE AT  THE SPEED   OF LIGHT 
                            By the  late 199Os, electronic  devices  such as pagers and cell phones  had already 
                       moved down  from the ranks    of the tech-elite into the pockets and belt-loops of the busy 
                       middle  class. Everyone from salesmen  working out   of their cars to working parents  try- 
                       ing to juggle grocery  shopping and  picking up high schoolers  from late-running track 
                       practice  took  advantage of the  convenience they  offered. It only took a little cultural 
                       adjustment  for that  convenience  to become  a mandatory condition. Phone numbers 
                       became  associated  with  people  instead  of addresses, and  combined  with  email    to 
                       derive  one  do-it-all number  with 24-hour access to anyone you want  to talk with  (see 
                       p. 35, Matrix Services, for more  information). As people  got used  to that state of con- 
                       stant connectedness,  they began  demanding  more  information in   a timelier manner, 
                       and the  marketing  gurus responded.  In  2061, there  are pagers  the size of a credstick 
                       that  let you  read-or   listen to-everything   from email  to  headline  news, as well as 
                       wristphones  that you wear instead  of a watch.  Both receive their data via the Matrix. 
                            Any home  in  2061  that can boast of even a modest  income can  also boast of some 
                       form  of cyberterminal.  The cyberterminal  takes  care of the  computing  needs   of the

       While a free search will only turn up a moderate amount   of information, more

  MATRIX      CULTURE 

  CULTURE    SHOCK   IN  3-D 
       At the turn of the century, one of the biggest concerns that existed regarding 
  the  Internet was the amount  of time people  seemed   to be spending on  it, to the 
  exclusion  of other  activities that  were regarded as healthy  and  normal. Online 
  games,  chat rooms, themed  text-based environments:  these were  just  a few of the 
  available entertainments  to which people  had   access. Compared   to what was   to 
  come,  they hadnt seen  anything yet. 
       In 2061 there are a myriad of different sim-based and trid-based entertainments 
  out  there  whose  addictive powers  blow anything  previously encountered  com- 
  pletely out of the water. Escapism and the tools to make it happen are at an all-time 
   high in the Sixth World, thanks to the Matrix. However, it says something about the 
  degree  to which the Matrix  has been  incorporated into society that such activities, 
  even  regarding  their addictive qualities, are not feared, but embraced.  The Matrix 
  world  is real enough that becoming immersed  in the Matrix is viewed as a common, 
  everyday occurrence. 

  Trideo  and  Music 
       Some    of the  entertainments  available   havent  changed  substantially  in 
  decades.  Chief among these  are forms  of recorded entertainment.  Recorded enter- 
  tainment  on the  Matrix can take many forms. Digital music, usually with   a trideo

                                                  with a standard  MSP account   (see p. 36, MSP  Accounts), or through  a pay chan- 
rt              ctronics and RGA-Unisys           nel. At last count, there were over a hundred thousand  different channels available 
                                                  on the  Matrix. 

                                                  Simsense   Recordings 
                                                        Simsense entertainment   is in a class by itself. The movement  from trideo to

                                      ndo        Needless  to say, this form of entertainment has become extremely   popular. 
                                      tage              The rise of sim technology has also set off a new life for both sports features and 
                                                  pornography. The chance to experience the power and emotion ofyour favorite urban 
                                                  brawl player or a diff diver from Aztlan is a powerful draw, as are the opportunities 
                                                  afforded by full sensory-immersion pornography films. The ability to get  the sensa- 
                                                  tions without any of the risks is a rush to many people, so films such as these have 
                                                  skyrocketed in sales (legality notwithstanding, in the case of pornography). 

                                                  Online  Games   and  VR Settings 
                                                        Other  popular entertainments  on the  Matrix are online games.  For those to 
                                                  whom   a pre-programmed  sim flick is boring, there are the interactive possibilities of 
                                                  the  online experience.  These are almost always sim-enabled,  and  being jacked-in 
                                                  gives you a definite advantage. Most  of these are combat-based  games with  a vari-

                                                  graphic. For those who dont enjoy shoot-em-ups, there  are also VR settings. These 
                                                  are sculpted environments that  are modeled on  a theme, often a historical period or 
                                                  a popular film or fiction setting. The participants act out the lives of a persona they 
                                                  create, with the specific possibilities limited only by the environment. 
                                                        VR  settings can also be modern-day settings. Virtual bars are a popular   of 
                                                  setting, with food and  drink available through  the wonders of sim technology. 
                                                  These settings have become the lonely Matrix-addicts dating service, and more  than 
                                                  one couple has been set up that way. The possibilities of sim and VR  settings have 
                                                  also given rise to virtual bordellos, which have caught on as well. The cottage indus-

                                                  are invariably on private hosts, the legal issues have been tricky to sort out. Still, vir-

                                                   sprawl management.  When you take     a few million people  and  cram them  into a 
                                                   space the size of the plex, it takes in-depth coordination to keep all those essential 
                                                   systems functioning. The Matrix is responsible for telecom service, traffic manage-

ment, power   management,    police and emergency  c6mmunications  and  tracking, 
and remote drone  operations  (such as cleaning streets  and picking up garbage). 

Telecom Service 
    The Sixth World  relies on communications.   If the info ever stops, then  every- 
ones  in big trouble.  Thus, the  Matrix carries a heavy  load in its telecom service 
duties.  Phone service today is handled through  private companies  that either  own 
or lease telecom  services on the Matrix. So, no matter who you have your phone 
service through, it all comes down  to the same  thing. Those same companies    are 
responsible for the public access telecom  units you see on almost every street cor- 
ner, with the maintenance  of any specific unit falling to the company  that owns it. 

Grid-Guide 
    The Grid-GuideTM   is the glue  that  holds traffic together  in the  Sea-Tac plex. 
Most of the cars sold for urban travel today are fitted with this intelligent traffic man- 
agement  system.  Grid-Guide   roads  are  standard  throughout  Seattle,  with  the 
Barrens area being the exception. When  a car enters a Grid-Guide compatible high- 
way and  activates its Grid-Guide system, the system sends the car on the  most effi- 
cient and timely route possible. Grid-Guide will even assist the vehicles autonav sys- 
tem in avoiding collisions and allowing emergency vehicles to pass, as well as man- 
age power consumption through the Gridlink induction-coil system. 

Power and Utilities 
    The Matrix  is also responsible for keeping the lights on, as well as keeping the 
gas and  the  water  flowing. All of these  systems use  the  Matrix to read  meters, 
measure  consumption, arrange   for maintenance  and troubleshoot computers.  The 
use of natural gas has decreased,  given the rise in cost and the  increasing rate of 
natural  resource depletion, so more homes and  businesses     are turning  into all- 
electric facilities. This means that most modern   structures are completely wired for         .    1 rw    seventh-gene 
the Matrix, giving a homeowner   a previously unmatched  level  of control over her               eck  is produced and 
environment.  The  Matrix also issues the  commands   for the  remote drones,  units                    ow keyboard-sized and 
that handle  many  of the  routine  physical jobs of city management,  such as trash 
collection and superstructure maintenance. 
                                                                                                               nown    as the chil-

     While you might  not think of Lone Star having  much,  if anything, to do with 
the Matrix, a high level of interaction actually occurs. The Matrix is responsible for         : An  elf decker    calling himself 
the information gathered  during the thumbprint searches done on suspects,  includ- 
ing warrants, criminal record and missing-persons  information, all while theyre still 
on the scene. They use the  Grid-Guide system  to  track vehicles, sometimes  over- 
riding the standard  routing protocols to direct the car into a waiting road block or 
a dead end. Alarms on private  property, silent or otherwise, alert Lone Star through 
the Matrix, including the security information the  system  has been able to gather 
on the intruders during the intrusion. 

MATRIX     LAW 

THE  LAW  OF  THE  LAND 
     Matrix law is a murky area, with misunderstandings  common.  Most users    are 
confused  about  Matrix law, to say the  least.  Its not  unheard of for a user to get 
caught  up in red tape  because  he did the wrong  thing in the wrong  host. To clar-              s of his will set the 
ify the  issue,  it is best  summed  up  in this statement:  the  laws of whatever host 
youre logged  into apply to what you  do there,  not the  laws of your physical loca- 
tion. With corps able to enforce  their own laws, as well as hosts  in other  nations 
that may have very  different laws from what youre  used to, its good to  keep this 
in mind. There  are some  things that are almost  universally illegal, such as piracy, 
trespassing  and  hacking.

                 lead                the   14th       Piracy laws are based on  the idea that it is (or should be) illegal for an indi- 
               t is a            to allow       vidual to copy and distribute  a work (be it text, music, video, or software) that 
  non-metahumans and other proba-               another individual created and sells. Thats a pretty simplified definition, but it cov- 
  tionary  citizens  legal   SINS   when      ers   the basic idea. So, making a copy of the music file of the latest release by your 
  vouched    for  by  a  UCAS   citizen in       favorite band and putting it on your pocket player for your own use is okay. Putting 
                                                that same  copy  in a public file and making it available to anyone who comes   in 
                                                 contact with it, whether for free or at a cost, is illegal. The same applies to anything 
                                                 that could be considered intellectual property. This is also sometimes called copy- 
                                                 right infringement. 
                                                      The penalties  for this crime vary greatly. Not all copyright owners pursue 
                                                 infringement with equal fervor, though violating the law with material that belongs 
                                                 to a corporation is likely to carry a stiff sentence. If someone pursues the case and 
                               hi, founds       youre found guilty, you can probably count on   a heavy fine, possibly along with 
                                                 probation or suspension of Matrix access.

  gence   (Al) named    Deus  seizes con-              Most hosts that are open to public visitors have a public-access area in their 
  trol of the Renraku Arcdogy, closing           host for just such a purpose. Trying to get from that public-access area into the off- 
  it to the outside world.                       limits places is called trespassing, and most corporations look on it with an unkind 
                                                 eye. Again, it is best to keep in mind that if you are in an extraterritorial corpora- 
              Otaku  tribes  beginning           tions property, whether virtual or physical, they have the right to prosecute you 
              0th in the Matrix and the          according to their own laws. Most off-limits areas are clearly marked, and nearly 
                                                 all of them require effort to get into. It is unlikely that the average user will be able 
                                                 to simply wander into an area that will get him into trouble. 

                                                 Hacking  Laws 
                                                       Hacking  is defined as using a cybertermfnal to willfully deface, destroy, or 
                                                 tamper  with  Matrix property belonging to another individual or corporation.  In 
                                                 simpler terms, you arent allowed to mess with someone elses hosts, icons, data, 
  down  for a  span of  eight mrnites,           and so on without permission. It is also defined as using a cyberterminal equipped 
  dumping  most  users and  driving              with  Masking or  Evasion programs   (in other words,  a cyberdeck) without  the 
  some insane. Originally thought    to be       licenses to do so. Those utilities block the tracing procedures used by the Matrix 
                    V                            and  hosts connected  to  it.  Because of what they  do,  those  utilities are  heavily 
                    A                            restricted and require licenses for legal use, which are given only to security deck- 
                                                 ers and those with a similar professional requirement. Hacking  is something that 
                                                 is almost always prosecuted,  if the suspect is traced and apprehended.  It is not 
                                                 taken lightly, and penalties are harsh, to say the least. Thankfully, this is an area of 
                                                 law that most legal users never encounter, as hacking is difficult to do accidental- 
                                                 ly. 
                                                 Privacy and Identity Laws 
                                                       All lawfully registered UCAS citizens have a SIN. This SIN is attached to their 
                                                 bank account, medical records, school transcripts, licenses, print and DNA records, 
                                                 and anything else for which they have to   fill out paperwork. That information is 
                                                 how we prove who we are these days, and     as such, its very important to protect 
                                                 it. Thats why we have privacy and identity laws in place. Privacy laws are intend- 
                                                 ed to keep anyone from modifying your information without your permission.     To 
                                                 do so is considered a serious crime, and incarceration is usually the sentence hand- 
                                                 ed down. Hand-in-hand with the privacy laws are the identity laws, which make it 
                                                 a crime  for any individual to steal or delete the  identity of another. This is also 
                                                 counted  as a serious crime, and often the guilty party is not only sentenced  to 
                                                 incarceration, but is forced to make restitution to the victim, up to and including 
                                                 the costs associated with starting a new legal identity, if necessary.

                         o access the virtual reallty of the  Matrlx, three  things are required: a speclailzed 

                    T    computer  called a cybertenninal, a jackpoint, and either an account with a Matrix 
                         Setvice  Provider  (MSP) or programs that  will allow you to fake an account.  The 
                         computer  interface is detailed in this chapter; the latter two requirements are dis- 
                    cussed  in Accessing  the Matrix (p. 30). 
                         A cyberterminal  is a computer  with an ASlST interface and  a suite of specialized 
                    programs  called the persona.  A persona  allows the user to interact with other icons in 
                    the Matrix. In effect, a cyberterminal allows the  user to experience  the sensory input 
                    of the virtual world. (Note that the cyberdeck commonly  used  by   deckers  is merely a 
                    souped-up  cyberterminal.   For clarity and ease of use,  cyberterminal will be  used to 
                    refer to both cyberterminals  and cyberdecks,  except where  the rules specifically apply 
                    to cyberdecks  only.) 
                         It is possible to access the  Matrix without  using  simsense and  virtual reality (in 
                    fact, millions of people  do it everyday  when they make  telecom     calls). This use is 
                    described under   Tortoise Mode  (p. 42). 
                         The following rules describe  the use of cyberterminals and cyberdecks.

                    itor or other  low-tech tools is considered  quaint. Most users prefer to access computer 
                    systems by creating  a direct link to their brain, which allows for high-speed  mental con- 
                    trol. To interface ones brain with a computer, one must first have some  way  of linking 
                    the two  together. Two devices  may  be used to create this link: trodes and datajacks. 

                    USING   TR0DF.S 
                         Trodes  are simply electrode nets that  are slipped  over a users head. Trodes  have 
                    numerous  contact points  that  are suctioned  onto the  users head over various  nerve 
                    clusters. These contact points read and send  electronic impulses  to the  brain and ner- 
                    vous  system.  Trodes come  in various styles, from simple,  functional nets  to discreet 
                    and  fashionable hairnets  and headbands   to flashy, stylized designs;  trodes are often 
                    built into wigs and helmets  as well.

    Trodes are connected to the cyberterminal through a sim-            format,  they are slightly  less real  than Dir-X feeds. Thus, it is 
ple  fiberoptic  cable.  Removing the  trodes  from  someones          easy to distinguish between a  basic system that takes advan-

                         smashin hacker, youre  likely   to spend   a big chunk   of your life in the Matrix. 
                            While  there   is no  typical  Matrix  user,  there    are  some  definite  differences 
                      between types     of Matrix  users.  joe  Cyberterminal    is going  to  look  like a retrograde 
                      loser  when  compared  to Jane Decker, with  her       slick moves,   sleek  icon and  blistering 
                      utilities. While the two   are bound  to hold   several characteristics  in common  merely by 
                      their  joint  use of virtual reality, deckers  and  security  sysops  are  much  more  focused 
                      and  specialized. 
                           This chapter  describes  the  relevance     of certain  attributes, skills, dice pools   and 
                      other  factors to  all Matrix users,  but to deckers  in particular. Any character who  plans 
                      on  using  the  Matrix should  take  note  here,  especially  those  who  enter  the  realm     of 
                      hacking and cybercombat. 
                            The children  of the Matrix   known   as otaku  are described  in the chapter  beginning 
                      on  p.  133. 

                      ATTRIBUTES 
                            The Matrix   is a unique environment  that presents  challenges  quite  different from 
                      those  found  in the  physical world. Consequently, certain character  attributes take  on 
                      extra importance  and others become         less important  when    a character  operates  in the 
                      Matrix. 
                            Physical attributes  have   little effect when  operating  in the  Matrix-after      all, in 
                      cyberspace  its your  persona,  not your meat  body, that counts.  This holds true even       for 
                      deckers.  Though    a  high  Body  rating may    be  useful when  it comes  to  shrugging      off 
                       black  IC, ICCM biofeedback  technology        (p. 21)  allows  deckers  to  depend  on  their 
                      Willpower instead.  Enough Quickness        For a decent  Reaction   is useful, but frankly, most 
                       hot deckers  depend on  their    decks,  not their meat,  for speed.

                         ccessing the Matrix seems   like an easy  process. You plug in your terminal, slip on 
                         the trodes, slap the power stud and  sit back as the icons of your local system blaze 
                         to life around you. Behind the scenes, though,  the actual procedures  involved  are 
                         quite  complex.  It takes  no  small  amount  of special  hardware,  authentication 
                    schemes and  background  processes  to bring that virtual world  to life. 
                         This section discusses the hidden technical aspects of accessing the Matrix, begin- 
                    ning with every deckers point   of entry: jackpoints and wireless links. This is followed 
                    by specifics on commonly available Matrix services, including types   of connections and 
                    features as  well as Matrix accounts.  It then moves  into  a  discussion of what those 
                    Matrix accounts  cover  and how  they work, including passcodes,   access privileges and 
                    the  incriminating datatrail, as well as how deckers subvert  these  systems.  Next,  the 
                    section covers perception   within  the  Matrix, dealing  with  the  iconography of both 
                    UMS (standard) and sculpted systems.  The chapter wraps up  with information on using 
                    tortoise mode  to get  online, for those  times when  jacking in isnt an option. 

                    THE   JACKPOINT 
                         The first step for any Matrix user is to physically connect their cyberterminal to the 
                    Matrix. This connection  is called the jackpoint. This section provides  parameters for a 
                    variety of jackpoint types. 
                         Note  that  it is also possible to connect  to the Matrix through  broadcast wireless 
                    transmissions  (see Wireless Links, p. 33). 

                    JACKPOINT    VALUES 
                         On the surface, most jackpoints  look the same.  They are roughly circular in shape, 
                    featuring a locking couple-top  to secure the connected cable and an  LED  that flashes to 
                    indicate active data traffic. This appearance is where the  similarity ends. The actual tech 
                    involved can differ widely from one jackpoint to another  and depends  on the type     of 
                    Matrix connection being  made. These connections can range from standard  hardwired 
                    Matrix lines to wireless links. Aside from the everyday legal connections, there is also a 
                    wide range   of illegal jackpoints possible, though  they require a bit of set-up  work.

ly plugs  his cyberterminal  into a jackpoint  and logs  onto the 
LTG  using  the passcode   for his MSP account.   If at work,  the 
employee   jacks in and logs on to his employers host   or PLTG. 
     Whenever  someone    calls, faxes or sends  email to the user, 
the  transmission  is directed through  the  Matrix  to  the jack- 
points  and  wireless  devices  associated  with  the  commcode. 
The attached device  then  rings  (phones and  telecoms),  prints 
out (fax machines) or logs the message  (computers, pagers  and 
phones)  as appropriate. 

PASSCODES 
     A passcode   is a security  device intended  to  keep  unau- 
thorized users out of a system and  allow the authorized  user to 
access an MSP account.  In effect,  passcodes   are access  codes 
that  guarantee  automatic success when       attempting  certain 
tasks or manipulating  specific  files on a system.  Any activity 
not authorized  by the  passcode   requires System Tests   (see p. 
209, SR.3) and  can jeopardize  the  passcode.  In other words,  a 
passcode  is a key that allows a user  to open  up certain locked 
doors within  a house;  depending  on the  privileges assigned  to 
the passcode,  the key will not work on certain  doors, requiring 
the user to pick the lock (what deckers   do). 
     Passcodes  come  in  various  formats  depending  on  the 
security needs  of the  provider. These can range from very sim- 
ple to exceedingly  complex, though system designers have       to 
keep  in mind  that  the  more  complex  the  passcode,  the  less 
user-friendly the  system.  Creating a good  passcode system    is 
therefore  often a struggle  to find a compromise between secu- 
rity and ease-of-use. 

Basic Passcodes 
     Simple passcodes  consist  of sets of symbols that  the  user 
enters  when  he wants  to log on.  If entered  correctly,  the  sys- 
tem  grants  the user access. The most  common passcodes       are 
alphanumeric strings. Because  the  Matrix    is a virtual  reality, 
passcode  symbols  can   also consist  of images,  tunes  or even 
specific movements. 

Linked  Passcodes 
     A linked pasxode  requires   an  extra  bit of input  from the 
user-an   extra  level of identification specific to a person or a 
cyberterminal. This can be a scan from a security scanner (retinal, 
fingerprint, palmprint  and so on) linked to the  cyberterminal or 
the correct signature from the cyberterminals MPCP.   If the scan 
or signature  doesnt match the records, access  will be denied. 

Passkeys 
     One  of the  most secure  ways   of controlling  access  to a 
system  is by means   of a passkey-a   module that  plugs into   a 
cyberterminal.  Many  corporations  require  this  accessory   for 
telecommuting  workers.  When     a logon  is attempted,  the  sys- 
tem  queries  the  module  in  the  cyberterminal.   If it doesnt 
receive  the  proper code, the user is denied  access. 

ACCOUNT PRIVILEGES 
     Most  accounts have    some   sort of limitation: after all, it 
doesnt make  sense  to  allow every   user  to  read  every  other

                          he world  telecommunications  network, referred     to as the  Matrix, is often com- 
                          pared  to the twentieth-century  Internet  in its scope  and design.  While such com- 

                     T    parisons are  inevitable, there are vast differences  between  the two. 
                          Unlike the  networks    of the  late twentieth  and  early  twenty-first  centuries,  the 
                     Matrix  is broken up into dozens   of semi-independent  regional telecommunication net- 
                     works,  or RTGs. The world  was  still recovering from the Crash  of 2029 when the Matrix 
                     was  being built, and the world powers  were  wary     of another  disaster. To combat  this 
                     problem,  in place   of the  decentralized  systems  and protocols that  typified  the  old 
                     worldwide  information systems,    a system  of tiered access was  developed.  In that way 
                     the local and regional communications  systems could operate  independently,  and thus 
                     potentially quarantine  a future info-plague. 
                          In addition to grids, the other  integral part of the Matrix is the host. Hosts are the 
                     servers  and mainframes   of the Sixth World. Through these  computer  installations Row 
                     untold trillions of megapulses,  containing everything  from Grandmas favorite recipes 
                     to bank transactions worth  millions  of nuyen. Hosts   are the true holders of wealth and 
                     power   in the Sixth World,  for they contain information-the   little ones  and zeros that 
                     make the world    go  round. 

                     CONNECTIONS 
                          The  Matrix runs over  a multitude of different connections,  but for most Matrix  traf- 
                     fic in 2061, the data  moves  over high-density fiberoptic lines  laid down  from the   late 
                     twentieth century  to the present  day. These lines  are capable  of handling an incredible 
                     amount   of data, an amount  almost inconceivable to   a user of the Internet in the 1990s. 
                      It is this backbone  that makes  the  Matrix possible. There  are  hundreds,   if not  thou- 
                     sands,  of separate  parts that go into the  running of the Matrix, but these  can general- 
                     ly be broken up into   a few broad  categories.

                         he Matrixs reliance on technology  sets the stage for a constant race against time.

                    deckers the impetus to upgrade   so they can meet  their opponents  head on, and  so the 
                    race for superiority continues. 
                         As the  primary weapon  on this battleground,  the  cyberterminal  is first in line for 
                    improvements.  With the right  skills, tools and nuyen, any user can upgrade and  create 
                    their own hardware, whether theyre    a legal user or a criminal decker. 
                         The following section details  the  process of constructing  a cyberterminal  (both 
                    legal cyberterminals and illegal cyberdecks), whether building one from scratch   or just 
                    upgrading components.     If the character is buying components  completely  assembled 
                    and ready  for use, skip ahead  to the Custom Designed Cyberterminals    section, p. 66. 

                    COMPONENTS 
                         In 2061,  most computer components      are designed  as modular, snap-in-and-use 
                    units, allowing a user to easily switch out  parts and  reconfigure the  computer. These 
                    modular  components    are  mass-produced  by various corps  and   are  readily available 
                    both  legally and  through  various shadow  contacts.  These plug-and-use  units usually 
                    have  a high fixed cost, but they allow the user to customize his cyberterminal by choos- 
                    ing components that  suit his needs  rather than purchasing a standard pre-made  model. 
                         Users  can  also  construct  these  modular  components  themselves,  using  the 
                    process  outlined under  Constructing Components,    p. 56). The process  involves plan- 
                    ning the project, writing the software, burning the chips, and then installing the com- 
                    ponents.  The final homemade component       is a custom-made,  modular  snap-in  unit. 
                    While this method  may take more time than finding the nearest  deckmeister and    drop- 
                    ping  a credstick into  her lap, it is cheaper  in the  long run and often more  personally 
                    satisfying to have a self-made  machine.  In many ways,   it allows the user to push the 
                    state-of-the-art  levels without  having to wait for the rest of the world to catch up.

MPCP 
    The Master Persona Control Program   is the base operating 
system for the cyberterminal. 
    No  persona program may  have    a  rating higher  than  the 
MPCP rating  OF the device.  Additionally, the combined  ratings 
of the  device's persona  programs  may  not exceed  the  MPCP 
rating  multiplied  by 3. Each  MPCP  is programmed  with    a 
default Rating 1 icon (see Icon Chip, p. 57). See The MPCPon 
page 20  for additional  rules. 
    If a character  replaces a cyberterminal's  MPCP with  an                                                                                  a

                        tilities are the  lifeblood of deckers, and  are  quite  useful to  non-decker users as 
                        well. This section introduces a number of new utilities and describes new uses for 
                   U    utilities originally presented in SR3. 
                        Multiplier: This value is used during programming  (see p. 76) to determine  the 
                   size OF the program. 
                        Options: These are the utility programming options  (see p. 83) that may be used 
                   to modify the utility. 

                   NEW    UTILITIES 
                        These utilities follow the same rules found under Utilities, p. 220. SR3. 

                   OPERATIONAL     UTILITIES 
                        Operational  utilities assist a user in conducting system  operations. For mote 
                   details on the nature and use of operational utilities, see p. 220, SR3. 
                        Options:  All operational  utilities may use the adaptive,  bug-ridden. crashguard, 
                   DINAB,  noise, one-shot, optimization, sensitlve, sneak and squeeze options (see UiYliW

Matrix users to quickly exchange data   to facilitate team  opera- 
tions  in Matrix combat.  Information  on  the  status of the  user 
and  his  cyberterminal, as well  as any  information  acquired 
through  the use of sensor programs, system operations and    so 
on, is instantly transmitted  to  other users who  are part of the 
BattleTac network.  Information  sent  to a BattleTac network  is 
automatically  accessible  to a user with a BattleTac Matrixlink. 
    To  initiate a Matrixlink, each user  that  plans on being part 
of the network must  be linked via a Make Comcall operation   (p. 
218, 97.3). However, unlike normal Make Comcall  operations, 
the  monitored  operation is maintained  by the Matrixlink utility 
rather  than  the user. Communication    via Matrixlink may   be 
monitored  via a Tap Comcall operation. 
    A BattleTac Matrixlink  also allows a user to use their Small 
Unit Tactics (Matrix Tactics) skill to gain an  Initiative bonus for 
their  Matrix  teammates.   To  do  so, the  user  must  take  a 
Complex  Action  and  communicate      orders  during  their  last 
action of a Combat Turn,  as described  on p. 47, MBJM.  The tar- 
get  number   for  this  test is 2, modified  by  wounds  and 
Perception modifiers. 
    A character  in the Matrix may not give  a bonus  to charac- 
ters not in the Matrix through  the BattleTac link, and vice versa. 
    A character using  BattleTac Matrixlink can only  exchange 
data  with a number  of others  equal  to  the  Matrixlinks rating 
or less.

                                NEW    OPERATIONS DESCRIPTIONS 
                                    The  following  system  operations  follow  the  same  guidelines  and  rules  as 
                                described in SR3. 

                                ABORT HOST SHUTDOWN 
                                    Test: Control 
                                    Utillty: Swerve 
                                    Action: Complex 
                                    The Abort Host Shutdown operation  allows  a user to temporarily keep a host from 
                                shutting down, or perhaps even to prevent it completely. This operation can be used 
                                to interfere with any host shutdown, whether it was initiated by a hostile decker using 
                                the Crash Host operation or by the hosts own security systems. 
                                    Every  2 net successes  on the  users Control Test prolongs the hosts shutdown 
                                sequence  by a full Combat Turn. If the user doubles the  net successes that a decker 
                                achieved with  a Crash Host operation, the  host shutdown  is completely averted.  A 
                                host shutdown initiated by an intruders security tally cannot be completely aborted; it 
                                can only be held off. 

                                ALTER ICON 
                                    Test: Control 
                                    Utility: Redecorate 
                                    Action: Complex 
                                    A  favorite of Matrix vandals, this operation allows a user to reprogram an icon and 
                                change its appearance.

                    NEW INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES 
                         This section provides six new types of IC: data bomb IC, Pavlov IC, scout IC, trace 
                    IC, cerebropathic IC and psychotropic  IC. Unless noted,  each type of IC uses the IC 
                    rules described in SR3. 

                    DATA   BOMB   WHITE  IC 
                         A data bomb   is a form of reactive IC that is attached  to a file or remote  slave- 
                    device icon. The armed data  bomb remains  in place until another icon accesses the file 
                    or device, at which point the bomb explodes and damages the  intruder. Unlike other 
                    IC, data  bombs are  not triggered  by security tallies; they attack  any user icon that 
                    accesses the  bomb-protected  icon. (See Trijggering Data Bombs, p. 104.) 
                         Only one data bomb may be attached to    a particular file or remote device. Data 
                    bombs may be attached to icons that are  also protected  by scramble IC. 
                         A data bomb  can be detected  by performing  a successful Analyze Icon operation 
                    against the bomb-protected  icon. 

                    Defusing  Data Bombs 
                         A data bomb   can be defused by simply entering the  correct passcode  (unfortu- 
                    nately, the person who set the data  bomb is usually the only person who knows the 
                    passcode). Without the passcode,  a detected data  bomb can only be disabled by a suc- 
                    cessful Disarm Data Bomb operation   (see p. 98). The defuse utility aids in this opera- 
                    tion. If the data bomb is protecting a file, the operation requires a Files Test. If it is pro- 
                    tecting a remote device, the  operation requires a Slave Test.

                    tem that enables gamemasters to quickly and easily create Matrix security systems. 

                    ADVANCED SECURITY 
                        The following  rules provide the gamemaster with guidelines   for applying security 
                    features to game play and introduce some new security options. 

                    SECURITY   TALLIES AND   MULTIPLE   ICONS 
                         Note that user icons generate  individual security tallies. For example, if multiple 
                    deckers are hacking a host, each deckers icon generates its own separate security tally. 
                    As each decker reaches certain trigger steps,  he will activate new copies  of IC pro- 
                    grams that will pursue him  specifically (even if a previous decker already killed the IC 
                    at that step). Generally, any effects that are triggered by a particular icon, such as IC, 
                    apply only to the icon that triggered them. 
                        The  two  exceptions to this general guideline are IC constructs and passive-alert 
                    effects. 
                         IC constructs (see p. 91) may attack any icon that has generated a sufficient secu- 
                    rity tally, not just the specific icon that triggered the construct. 
                         During d passive alert (p. 21 1, SR3), each of a systems subsystem ratings increases 
                    by 2. These increases affect all users in the system, not just the icon that tripped the alert. 
                         For the most part, passive and active alerts have no effect on legitimate users, 
                    because the accounts  of these users allow them to automatically succeed at legitimate 
                    activities. In fact, such users will most likely be unaware that an intrusion is occurring. 
                         See Security Talk, p. 2 10, SR3, for basic Security Tally rules.

                         iven  the  constant  escalation of hostilities  between  hackers  and  Matrix security 
                         designers,  it is not  surprising  that  both sides constantly  develop new  tricks 
                         designed  to  frustrate  their  opponents.  The following grid tricks, host  tricks and 
                         decker  tricks are merely a sampling  of the  latest tricks in use. 

                     GRID   TRICKS 
                          The following system  trick-the  comcall  trace-is  available only to grid providers. 

                     COMCALL     TRACE 
                          Grid providers  have the  ability to run traces against  comcalls, though they usual- 
                     ly do so only when  pursuing their  own  investigations  or when  ordered   to do so by  a 
                     court (national or Corporate Court) to provide assistance  to an outside  security agency. 

                     Tracing Standard   Corncalls 
                          To run a trace,  the  provider  must be  able to lock onto a call in process.  The call 
                     must  be originating,  ending or passing  through  the  providers grid.  Usually, the grid 
                     provider monitors  a commcode,  waiting    for an incoming  call, then  traces  it back to its 
                     source. 
                          When the  comcall   is in progress,  the  grid provider makes a test  using the grids 
                     Security Value against a Target Number    of 2. Increase the target  number  by 1 for each 
                     additional grid the comcall passes  through  from origin to destination. If the caller takes 
                     advantage   of fake MSP accounts  to forward the   call (see p. 122), apply an additional 
                     + 1 modifier for each  forward. 
                          The trace takes a base time  of 10 Combat Turns. Modify this base number  by the 
                     trace  modifier of the calls origin (see TRe lackpoint, p. 30). For example, a call origi- 
                     nating  from a legally registered  MSP account has   a trace  modifier of -2, so the  base 
                     time would  be  8 (1 0 - 2) Combat Turns. 
                          Divide the  base time  by the  number  of successes achieved  on the  grids Security 
                     Value Test; round up. The result is the number  of Combat Turns  it takes the grid to trace 
                     the call. Once  the call is traced, the  grid provider knows  the commcode   of the caller 
                     and the  physical origin of the call.

                           s the dataterms on  every downtown  street  corner  attest,  the  world  of 2061  is an 
                           information-saturated society.  The combination   of cheap and  readily available elec- 
                           tronic storage mediums and advanced   high-bandwidth  communications networks 
                           places vast  amounts  of data at the fingertips of even inexperienced  computer  users. 
                      Finding  useful information in this sea of data  requires  information searches. 
                           Information  searches  can  be  performed  in  two  ways.  Characters  can  use the 
                      Matrix specialization  of the  Etiquette skill or the Computer  skill. 

                      USING ETlQUETlE (MATRIX) 
                           Besides being   a realm  of information, the  Matrix is a popular place  for people  to 
                      spend  time,  which makes  it  a fertile ground for dealing  with contacts.  Characters use 
                      their Etiquette skill to interact with contacts  in the Matrix. 

                      MATRIX    SOCIAL   SITUATIONS 
                           The Etiquette  skill encompasses   a characters ability to fit in in social situations 
                      and  avoid social blunders. 
                           The virtual nature of the Matrix makes    it quite different from other social environ- 
                      ments,  however.   To  begin with,  the  icons used  by every  Matrix  user hide  body  lan- 
                      guage,  facial expressions,  style of communication,  even  the  very identity  of the user. 
                      For example,  a snappy  corporate  power-player  icon may  belong       to the  Mr. Johnson 
                      whos  waiting  for your  paydata  delivery-or   it may actually belong    to a 14-year-old 
                      code  kiddie, a rambunctious  practical  joker, or a dangerous  decker. 
                           The Matrix specialization  of the Etiquette skill provides  knowledge   of such unique 
                      features of the Matrix  social environment.  The specialization  also encompasses  knowl- 
                      edge  of basic Matrix slang, customs  and netiquette,  the  latest Matrix advances and 
                      the current Matrix movers and shakers,     as well as the  best virtual places to find Matrix 
                      contacts  and post  public queries.

                                     cyberworld. Many   of these stories are no more than rumors and fictions created  to 
                                     frighten newbies  and  burnish the  reputations of the  Matrix elite. But among the 
                                megapulses   of legends,  one stands out: the stories of the otaku, the so-called children 
                                of the Matrix. 
                                     At first, rumors of the otaku were  considered  hardly credible. Few were  ready  to 
                                believe in these  children, said to journey through  the Matrix without cyberdecks, com- 
                                manding   it with their wills alone. As more and more accounts   of these  mysterious fig- 
                                ures filtered in, the  debate  over the  otaku began  to grow  in the shadow  community. 
                                Before  long, the otaku found their own voices and began  speaking   for themselves. This 
                                evoked amazement  and curiosity, but it quickly became    clear that these otaku postings 
                                raised even more questions  than they answered.  The otakus views about  their abilities 
                                and  origins are layered in mysticism and youthful idealism, and the  world views of indi- 
                                vidual otaku frequently conflict or even contradict each other. 
                                     In recent years,  the  stories about  otaku  have taken an ominous  turn.  Once por- 
                                trayed  as harmless  curiosities guided  by an  unknown  but non-threatening  entity   or 
                                process,  the otaku are developing   a darker image,  fueled by rumors  of their religious 
                                infighting and  cult-like devotion  to  alleged  artificial intelligences.  Increasingly,  the 
                                otaku  are  no  longer  viewed  as  innocent  and  bright-eyed  children-but   as  battle- 
                                scarred, fanatical and dangerous  individuals. 

                                THE   REALITY 
                                     Otaku  are individuals who  speak the  language   of the  Matrix, and  the Matrix lis- 
                                tens.  They  can  access  the  Matrix  without  cyberterminals,  using  living  personas. 
                                Similarly, they  can manipulate  the  Matrix without  programs,  using instead  channels, 
                                complex   forms  and sprites. 
                                     These abilities stem  from the  otakus natural affinity for the  cyberworld.  Unlike 
                                other  living creatures,  the otaku take  to the  Matrix as if it were  their natural environ- 
                                ment.  This affinity also extends  toward  other  native Matrix entitie-in   particular, the

                          hile frames and  agents are the drones  and robots  of the  Matrix, on the virtual 
                          evolutionary scale autonomous  programs  are  a quantum leap  higher. While  cre- 
                          ated  from code  like other programs, they have  the  ability to perform  complex 
                          tasks that  mimic  intelligent  thought,  and  they also possess  the  capability to 
                    learn, grow and even  adapt  on their own. 
                         Autonomous   programs      fall into  two  categories.   First,  there are  semi- 
                    autonomous  knowbots     (SKs), expert  systems  with  high-density,  random-decision- 
                    making pathways. Above  them     are the  mightiest  creatures of the  Matrix, the  pow- 
                    erful artificial intelligences  (Als). 

                    SEMI-AUTONOMOUS KNOWBOTS 
                         Capable of self-directed data transport on the  Matrix, semi-autonomous  knowbots 
                    (or SKs) are mobile virtual machines; personas without cyberdecks.  They are the  most 
                    complex programs  written,  requiring highly complex  code-cde      that is far beyond 
                    the  programming  abilities of canned  algorithm  generators and  comp-sci  expert  sys- 
                    tems.  In game  terms,  programming   SKs  requires the use of, at minimum,  a Red-10 
                    host and programming    resources equal to a half-dozen top  programmers.  An  SK rep- 
                    resents a serious expenditure  of Matrix assets  by a major power. This means  SKs are 
                    relatively rare in even in 2061, especially in light of the events at the Renraku Arcology. 

                    DESIGNING   SKs 
                         SKs are  designed  using  the same  template  as frames  and agents  (see  p. 88). 
                    Because programming  an    SK  is beyond  the  capability of player characters,  the rules 
                    below  do not include statistics essential for programming,  such as the multiplier of an 
                    SK  frame core.  Instead, these rules should be used as guidelines when a gamemaster 
                    is creating  an SKs characteristics for game  purposes. 

                    Frame  Core  and  MPCP 
                         Like frames and agents,  an SKs MPCP   is determined  by its frame core rating. The 
                    frame-core  rating of an SK can be any rating, with a maximum   of 14.

                         Matrix increasingly dictates how  the world works.  The  megacorps   all realize this 
                         and are involved to one  degree   or another  in software and hardware develop- 
                    ment-the     Matrix is a very lucrative pie, and they just cant resist the temptation to 
                    stick their fingers into it. Following close behind the megas are a host of smaller corps, 
                    from extraterritorials to tiny nationals. And its not only big business that realizes the 
                    Matrixs potential-almost  every conceivable type   of organization, from hacker groups 
                    to gangs to criminal syndicates and religious groups, have started using the Matrix to 
                    further their goals. 

                    THE   PROVIDERS 
                         The  Matrix isnt a free-floating entity-without  the network of regional and local 
                    grids that provide  its backbone, it wouldnt even exist.  Nearly    all these  grids are 
                    owned and operated  by corps, with gives them frighteningly easy access to terapuls- 
                    es of data. (Of course, the  sheer volume  of data makes it impossible   for most to sift 
                    through it all and actually take advantage of their access.) But these corps continue to

                    the datastream. Speaking   of the dragon  . . . 

                    THE  BIG PLAYER: SAEDER-KRUPP 
                         The wiz-worms pet  corp, Saeder-Krupp, is at the head    of the grid pack. It owns 
                    and operates the  regional grids  for Austria, Hungary, France, Poland, Spain and the 
                    Balkan States. S-K also runs the Orbital Dynamix satellite constellation and likely has a
