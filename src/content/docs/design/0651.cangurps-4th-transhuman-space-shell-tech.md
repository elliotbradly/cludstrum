some kind of subversive, anti-human agenda. Furthermore,
few jobs really require a infomorph mind in a biological body;
there’s usually some kind of mechanical shell which can do
things better. However, there are always somespecialist tasks
which can use the intellect of an AI and the special abilities of
an organic body, and an infomorph in an apparently nonsapi-
ent organic body, especially one that’s clearly marked, isn’t
always assumed to be up to no good. For that matter, some
bioshells are explicitly intendedto frighten people.
  Remember that a bioshell’s Immunity to Metabolic Hazards
extends to brain infections, psychotropic agents, jet lag, etc.;
however, anything that affects other parts of the body will still
have an effect, possibly reduced if its primary effect is on the
brain.
