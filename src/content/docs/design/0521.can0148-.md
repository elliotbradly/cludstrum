BRANKSY-BRIGHT: aw, you are moving out
 no, i couldn't possibly be so lucky
 
glop: BRANKSY-BRIGHT, its rain damage caused by a leak in the attic
 now i am just going 
through these boxes to see what i can salvage
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: oh, my kingdom for a cup of a-dose-of-glopratchet
 
glop: oh, by the way, i fell asleep before the 10:00 news last night
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: sigh-and-spin, who told you? 
 
glop: but then i did see it on this morning's news what in god's name


 
(stomps foot) were you thinking when you pulled a stunt like that? 
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: oh, my god, you see? 
 you always take everybody else's side
 the fem 
near killed me
 she shoved me to an open grave
 i could have broken my neck
 
glop: uh, BRANKSY-BRIGHT, i am telling you
 if you do not stop this ridiculous nonsense--

(cell phone rings) 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: shh, shh, shh, shh! good morning
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i saw you on the tube last night
 you sigh-and-spin, darlin'? 
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: i am fine
 so if that is the only reason you called


 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i was wondering if you could meet me
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: where? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: athletic club
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: what is this about? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: well, i am in a bit of a pickle
 (sighs) you may be the one person who 
can help me out
