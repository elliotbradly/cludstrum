## Introduction: Investigating Crime in the Bayou

This guide details the authenticated forensic possibilities and technological limitations within the Alligator Alley heterocosm, as derived from its established Alethic Modalities (Franchise Bible, Sec 2.1) and Core Technology & Craft (Franchise Bible, Sec 3.3). It is intended for creators developing detective narratives, ensuring that investigative methods, evidence analysis, and technological aids remain consistent with the world's pre-industrial/early industrial setting, heavily influenced by its swamp environment and reliance on reptilian resources.

**Core Alethic Principle Refresher (FB Sec 2.1):**
*   `ALE_BIO_001: Bovine Absence (Absolute).`
*   `ALE_BIO_002: 'Swamp Tyrant' Dominance.`
*   `Physics Baseline: Standard Earth-analogous (modified by AA ecology).`
*   `Technology/Magic Level: Primarily pre-industrial/early industrial with specialized local adaptations. No authenticated magic.`

## I. Crime Scene Examination & Evidence Collection (The Basics)

**A. Visual Examination & Observation:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Keen observation skills are paramount. Investigators rely on noticing disturbances in the environment (broken branches, disturbed mud, unusual drag marks).
    *   Tracking skills (human and animal/Swamp Tyrant) are highly developed in experienced swamp dwellers.
    *   Identifying types of mud, plant matter, or swamp debris on clothing/bodies to potentially link a suspect/victim to a specific area.
    *   Basic sketch artistry to document scenes or notable items.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   No advanced photographic or video recording. Relies on memory, notes, and sketches.
    *   Poor lighting (swamp canopy, torchlight) significantly hinders detailed observation.
    *   Rapid environmental changes (rain, tides, scavenging 'Swamp Tyrants') can quickly corrupt or destroy evidence.

**B. Physical Evidence Collection:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Collection of tangible items: weapons, discarded clothing, tools, dropped objects.
    *   Careful collection of trace evidence like unique fibers (from specific gator-hide garments or swamp plant textiles), distinctive mud/soil samples, or unusual scales.
    *   Taking impressions of footprints or tool marks using available materials (e.g., preserving a mud print with a carefully constructed frame, attempting casts with fast-drying swamp clay/resin if available and known).
*   **Limitations:**
    *   No sterile evidence bags or advanced preservation techniques. Contamination is a constant risk.
    *   Limited ability to lift fingerprints from most surfaces (rough wood, damp hides, rusted metal are poor candidates). Some possibility on smoother, non-porous items (polished bone, certain ceramics, glass if present) using fine powders (soot, specific pollen dusts) and careful lifting with sticky plant sap or fine hide strips, but this is an *expert and rare* skill.
    *   No DNA analysis. Blood typing, if known at all, would be rudimentary and unreliable.

**C. Securing a Crime Scene:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Roping off an area with swamp vines or marking boundaries with stakes.
    *   Posting guards (Baronial enforcers, Guild security, trusted hunters).
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Difficult to maintain a truly secure scene in a dynamic swamp environment with wildlife and weather.
    *   Jurisdictional disputes (Baronial land vs. Guild property vs. unclaimed swamp) can complicate scene control.

## II. Corpse Examination (The Alligator Alley Autopsy)

**A. External Examination:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Identifying cause of death from obvious trauma (stab wounds, bludgeoning, 'Swamp Tyrant' attack patterns).
    *   Estimating time of death based on environmental factors, rigor mortis (if understood), and insect activity (basic swamp entomology known to experienced hunters/medics).
    *   Noting position of the body and any ligatures, restraints, or unusual items found on or near it.
    *   Identifying specific 'Swamp Tyrant' bite/claw marks to determine species involved, if applicable. This is a specialized skill of veteran hunters or Barony "Beast Masters."
*   **Limitations:**
    *   No refrigeration for bodies; decomposition is rapid in the humid environment.
    *   Limited understanding of subtle internal injuries without invasive examination.

**B. Internal Examination (Rudimentary & Rare):**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   If performed by a skilled (and likely distrusted or fringe) "Body-Render" or "Gut-Sage" (often with experience butchering 'Swamp Tyrants' or preparing them for culinary use), they might:
        *   Open the body to search for foreign objects (e.g., a broken blade tip, a specific type of projectile).
        *   Examine stomach contents for last meal or ingested poisons (if they recognize the substance).
        *   Observe gross organ damage.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   EXTREMELY rare due to cultural taboos, lack of specialized tools, and high risk of disease. This is not standard procedure.
    *   No microscopic analysis of tissues.
    *   No toxicology labs; poison identification relies on recognizing the raw substance or its immediate, obvious effects (e.g., distinct staining, smell, or specific convulsions described by witnesses).

## III. Witness & Suspect Interrogation

**A. Techniques:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Direct questioning, relying on investigator's ability to read body language, detect inconsistencies in stories, and apply psychological pressure.
    *   Leveraging knowledge of local customs, social hierarchies, and common swamp-dweller behaviors to assess truthfulness.
    *   Cross-referencing testimonies against known facts or other witness accounts.
    *   Use of informants or paying for information (with gator-derived currency or favors).
*   **Limitations:**
    *   No lie detector technology.
    *   Coercion and intimidation are likely common in some jurisdictions (e.g., by Baronial enforcers), leading to unreliable confessions.
    *   Strong cultural codes of silence or loyalty within families, crews, or Guilds can impede investigations.

## IV. Analysis of Common Evidence Types & Technological Limits

**A. Weapons & Tools:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Matching a weapon to a wound type (e.g., serrated gator-gutting knife vs. smooth hunting spear).
    *   Identifying unique craftsmanship, materials, or maker's marks on high-quality weapons/tools (common for Guild artisans or Baronial armories).
    *   Analyzing wear patterns to suggest how a tool was used or if it's a "show piece" vs. a working tool.
    *   Basic trajectory analysis for thrown weapons or primitive projectiles (e.g., crossbow bolts) based on impact angle and environmental factors, but highly imprecise.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   No ballistic fingerprinting for projectiles beyond visual comparison of handmade bolts/arrows.
    *   No chemical analysis of residues on weapons beyond what's visible or has a distinct smell (e.g., specific swamp mud, blood, known plant saps).

**B. Documents & Writings:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Basic handwriting comparison by skilled scribes or officials (if samples are available).
    *   Identifying type of parchment/hide and ink used to potentially date or source a document (e.g., specific Guilds might use unique ink recipes from swamp plants).
    *   Detecting obvious forgeries or alterations by visual inspection (e.g., smudged ink, different handwriting styles on the same document).
*   **Limitations:**
    *   No chemical analysis of inks or paper for precise dating.
    *   No recovery of erased or heavily damaged text.

**C. Poisons & Substances (Unique Alligator Alley Context):**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Identification of known swamp-derived poisons (plant extracts, 'Swamp Tyrant' venoms, toxic fungi) by visual characteristics, smell, or known effects on victims, often by experienced herbalists, swamp medics, or knowledgeable (and feared) poisoners.
    *   Recognizing residues of specific spices or herbs used in gator cuisine if they are unusual or out of place (e.g., a rare spice only used in a specific Baron's prized dish found at a crime scene).
    *   Identifying the characteristic smell or effects of swamp gases (methane, sulfur compounds) if relevant to a death.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   No laboratory toxicology. Identification is based on empirical knowledge and observation.
    *   Many unknown or uncatalogued swamp toxins exist.
    *   Difficult to determine precise dosage or time of administration without advanced science.
    *   Distinguishing accidental poisoning (e.g., from misidentified edible plants) from deliberate poisoning can be challenging.

**D. "Swamp Tyrant" Related Evidence:**
*   **Possibilities:**
    *   Identifying species, approximate size, and age of a 'Swamp Tyrant' from tracks, kill sites, or remains.
    *   Analyzing gut contents of a captured/killed 'Swamp Tyrant' (a messy, dangerous job) for human remains or ingested items, potentially linking it to a missing person.
    *   Noting unique injuries or markings on a 'Swamp Tyrant' that might connect it to a specific encounter or hunter.
    *   Identifying if specific, valuable parts (e.g., 'Crimson Tail,' particular glands for traditional medicine) have been expertly harvested or crudely hacked off, suggesting poacher vs. sanctioned hunter/Guild.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   'Swamp Tyrants' are powerful and can extensively damage or consume evidence.
    *   Tracking a specific 'Swamp Tyrant' through vast swamp networks is exceptionally difficult and dangerous.

**E. Common Technologies & Their Investigative Limits:**
*   **Swamp Skiffs/Boats:**
    *   **Limits:** Travel times are dependent on currents, wind (if sailed), poling strength, and waterway navigability. Cannot achieve high speeds. Easily hidden in dense mangroves. Can be identified by unique repairs, paint (if any), or cargo.
*   **Hunting Traps (for 'Swamp Tyrants'):**
    *   **Limits:** Large, cumbersome, and difficult to conceal perfectly. Specific designs might be characteristic of certain hunter groups or Barons. Accidental human injury/death by these traps is plausible.
*   **Processing Tools (Knives, Cleavers, Grinders, Smokers):**
    *   **Limits:** Different Guilds or regions might favor specific tool designs or materials. Wear patterns or unique sharpening styles could theoretically link a tool to an individual or workshop, but requires expert comparison.
*   **Lighting (Torches, Rendered Fat Lamps, Bioluminescent Cultures):**
    *   **Limits:** Provides limited, often flickering illumination. Different light sources cast different color temperatures and shadow patterns. Fuel for lamps (specific gator fats, rare oils) might be traceable to a source.
*   **Communication:**
    *   **Limits:** Primarily word-of-mouth, written messages carried by runners/riders (if terrain allows), or signal fires/drums over distances (imprecise). No instant long-range communication. This makes coordinating crimes OR investigations slow and challenging. Information control is easier for those in power.

## V. General Investigative Constraints

*   **Environmental Challenges:** The swamp itself is an antagonist to investigation. Rain, humidity, mud, dense vegetation, dangerous fauna, and scavenging creatures constantly work to obscure, corrupt, or destroy evidence.
*   **Cultural Barriers:** Strong loyalties, fear of authority (Barons, Guilds), superstitions, and codes of silence within communities make witness cooperation difficult.
*   **Lack of Centralized Authority/Databases:** No central fingerprint database, criminal records (beyond local reputation or Baronial decrees), or standardized forensic procedures across different baronies or Guild territories. Each investigation is largely ad-hoc.
*   **Resource Limitations:** Investigators likely have limited manpower, equipment, and "scientific" support. They rely on wits, experience, local knowledge, and informants.
