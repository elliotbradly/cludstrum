                                                                                                                                                                                      none of which is  the answer.

                                                                                                                                                              These are the doorways through which I welcome wonders and terrors

           The Wheel

He sleeps. In his dreams he sees the bloated shape of the prayer wheel spinning, ever 
spinning, propelled by the wind. Bolted to a rocky precipice, overlooking the sea, its rust-
ing metal body tattooed with glyphs. A storm moves across the coast, all lashing rain and 
howling wind. The wheel spins faster and faster, its clotted axle sending metallic screams 
into the leaden skies like blasphemous paeans to the gods. Faster and faster it turns, 
the glyphs glowing red from the friction and merging into a single word. The word is 
wrong, somehow, written in a language never devised by men and it hurts his eyes. He 
approaches the wheel, drawn to it involuntarily, the word burning in his mind. The wheel 
spins faster still, growing hotter. Raindrops evaporate from the heat, sending up clouds 
of hissing steam. He hears voices on the wind, wailing in harmony with the shrieking of 
the wheel. They call to him, whispering his name, urging him to quench the heat with his 
blood. The phone rings.

                                                                                        3

      He sleeps. The storm has come again and he stands beside the wheel, wet hair plastered 
      to his head. The glyphs on the wheel are gone and, in a flash of lightning, he sees key-
      holes painted in their place. One by one, stars appear in the keyholes, shining dully, leaving 
      streamers of light as the wheel turns. The winds screams in his ears, the voices gibber 
      and laugh insanely. In slow motion he sees himself reach out to stop the wheel, just like 
      poor Niko reached out to touch it. His mind screams with the danger, visions of Niko’s fin-
      gers spurting blood flickering through his sight like film on a faltering projector. The fins 
      slice through his hands, snicker-snack, and he feels nothing, only an icy-cold that seeps up 
      his arms. Impossibly, the mauled remains of his hands obey his commands and grasp the 
      wheel, sliding on its wet surface before catching it and holding it still. The wind dies, the 
      voices stop and the storm abates. All is quiet. The cold moon stares down at him and he 
      begins to shake, the chill from his arms spreading to his chest. He stares at the wheel 
      and sees a shadow pass over the stars twinkling out of the keyholes. The cold has spread 
      its icy fingers to his heart, the chill freezing the blood in his veins. His shakes become 
      more violent, his body spasms, dancing a lunatic jig. Eyes appear at the keyholes, starkly 
      white against the black, pupils a putrid yellow. The eyes stare at him and he screams.

March 9
I keep this secret accounting of my work and the  
summoning ritual, as a testament. You, who have dis-
covered this secret, will bear witness to my triumph, 
to the ascendance of the ancient. It calls to me in my 
dreams, promising me immortality, riches and more.  
I will be the first disciple and rule over the Earth as 
a god. Those of my line will become prophets to my glory, 
walking among the herds in forms of terrible splendor.  
I begin.

March 12
The summoning was a success. I have spoken to the an-
cient and forged a pact. Upon the morrow I’ll beg 
in construction. Glory to the name I dare not write! 
He who is Lord of Nightmares, King of Fever Dreams, 
Prince of Insanity!

April 16
The Wheel is done.

April 20
The thing is finished. I have inscribed the 29 names of 
the ancient onto the Wheel and anointed them with my 
blood, binding the turning of the wheel not only to me, 
but to my family line. Tomorrow I will place the Wheel 
on the highest point of the cliffs where it will catch the 
ocean winds. In accordance with the pact I have made, 
the Wheel will turn for 100 years and for every second 
of every day of every year it turns, me and mine will 
be rewarded with fortune and glory. Each time the 
Wheel turns the names of the ancient will be shouted to 
the heavens, defying the banishment that traps it out 
of space and time. When I die my soul will be  
drawn through the Wheel to the ancient’s side where  
I’ll bask in its splendor and be rewarded with  
a new body, not of flesh but of the Void: vast and  
eternal. The souls of my descendants will enhance the 
hideous strength of the Wheel as it turns, like a key in a 
lock, sacrifices for my godhood. They will die for me, and 
the ancient will return, I at his side.

From Distant 

                           Shores

             “Dad, you always have to complicate things. Why do you do that?”
             Ikon’s tone was one of pure exasperation. The young willworker paced anxiously; he hadn’t seen his father in 
           nearly half a decade, but the old man still knew how to get his goat. For his part, Charon chuckled, his voice 
           sonorous and deep, “Fine. We’ll change the subject. Have you been practicing the summonings I taught you?”
             The younger Moros quirked an eyebrow. “Seriously, Dad, what kind of a dumbshit question is that? This is 
           the first time we’ve seen each other in years and that’s the best thing you can think to ask?”
             “Fredrick Thomas Alcott, you will mind your language in my presence.”
             Inwardly, Ikon cringed, just a bit. Even after all this time, those three names — recited in precisely that 
           tone of voice — had the power to make him feel like a four-year-old who’d just knocked over an antique vase. He 
           looked away, unable to meet Charon’s steely gaze. The Necromancer focused, instead, upon a single, indelible 
           reality: this is not my father. My father is dead. That is just his reflection.
             “Sorry, Dad,” Ikon muttered, turning once more to face the shadowy figure seated before him. “These past 
           few years have been hell. I’m not the man you remember, anymore.”
             Charon smiled warmly. “You’re still my son, Freddie. That’s all that matters.”
             The younger Alcott frowned. “You don’t understand. The Consilium’s falling apart; has been since you and 
           Ascalon were killed by those Banishers. After that, the Scarlet Mummers withdrew their support from the 
           Council and skipped town. About a year later, the Harbingers overthrew the Hierarch—”
             “Giselle?” Charon interjected, incredulously.
             Ikon nodded once. “Yeah. We’ve been without one, ever since.” Of course, he would’ve never dared to refer to 
           the former Hierarch — even now — by her first name, even if it was an alias, but she and his father were… 
           close, once.
             “So,” the old man huffed, “you need my help, then?” His features set in that stubborn way he had, and which 
           Ikon remembered so well. “What do you need me to do, son?”
             “Everything,” Ikon whispered hoarsely, “and nothing, at all.”
             The seals under the Persian rug flared to life, surrounding Charon’s shade on all sides. The ghost cried out 
           in obvious pain and fear, but the young Moros kept his will sharp and focused. The elder Alcott called to his 
           son in a panic, “Freddie? What are you doing?”
             Unshed tears burned in Ikon’s eyes as he replied, “You’re not my father. You’re a thing that I summoned 
           from the Underworld. Like a chair… a car… a weapon.”
             Charon toppled from his seat, upending it with a crash. “You don’t understand, Freddie: what I taught you 
           was wrong. It’s me. It really is me.”
             “No, it’s not.” Ikon’s voice grew stronger, steadier, “You still carry the echoes of my father’s magic, though, 
           and this Consilium needs a new Hierarch; a strong Hierarch. Alone, I can’t take the seat, but with your power 
           at my disposal…”
             The ghost screamed again, as yet another ring of binding sigils began to glow.

    It’s been a bad intersection since day one. Over the     Influence: Misfortune 4
  years, 27 people have died in auto accidents at the     Numina: Discorporation, Harrow, Psychic Tor-
  intersection of 6th
                    Avenue and Lake Street. No one      ment, Soul Snatch
  is quite sure why; the visibility is just fine, and there 
  are no more potholes or other safety hazards than at 
  any other corner for a mile in every direction, but 
  that’s just how it is. All of that dying and the 
  persistent local dread attached to the intersec-
  tion have given rise to a potent spirit, whose 
  powers and interests now go well beyond 
  fatal car crashes.
    Possessing  a  vaguely  humanoid 
  shape, 6th
            and Lake is comprised of 
  twisted metal and broken windshield 
  glass, spattered, here and there, with 
  fresh blood. The spirit smells of leak-
  ing  gasoline,  burning  rubber,  and 
  smoldering upholstery, as well as a 
  faint odor of fear. The metallic com-
  ponents of its form shriek loudly on one 
  another when it moves, while the glass 
  continually crunches. No matter what 
  it says, 6th
            and Lake’s voice sounds like 
  a chorus of frantic pleas for help from 
  within the acrid smoke billowing 
  out of a car on fire.
    A  summoner  who  desires 
  insight  into  any  sort  of 
  misfortune  (her  own  or 
  that of others) might call 6th
                            
  and Lake, though only the 
  most powerful do so lightly, as 
  the gruesome mythology which has sprung 
  up around the spirit’s intersection 
  has made it powerful, indeed. For 
  the right price, 6th

  certainly be willing to inflict its

    Thor. Perun. Susano’o. Indra. Shango. He has worn 
  all of these names and many more, besides. From 
  the first moment that humans looked up to behold 
  lightning splitting the sky, he was there, hurling 
  bright spears and smiting the vault of the heavens 
  with  his  cudgel.  With  a  temperament as 
  dynamic (and, often, wrathful) as the 
  elemental fury that he embodies, the 
  Thunderer is a powerful, masculine 
  deity, venerated by countless societies 
  — from fearful clans of Neolithic hunter-
  gatherers, to some of the strongest empires 
  in history — throughout the long ages of the 
  world. The Thunderer is a warrior and, just as 
  often, a troublemaker. Sometimes, he is steadfastly 
  loyal and, at other times, he is fickle, with all of 
  the tact and decorum of a spoiled child. He is 
  unimaginably intimidating, but possessed of the 
  demeanor of royalty; frequently, he is either the 
  son of a pantheon’s Sky Father or else he, himself, 
  fulfills that lofty role.
    The Thunderer’s avatar towers over mere mortals. 
  His massive, muscular frame is wreathed in roiling 
  dark clouds and his wild hair and long beard are 
  woven of writhing strands of lightning. His eyes 
  reflect the raw power of every storm ever to shake 
  Heaven and Earth since the dawn of time. He is 
  always armed: with a spear, warhammer, club, or 
  other weapon indicative of thunder, lightning, or 
  both. When he speaks, those before him are whipped 
  by gale-force winds and lashed by driving rain. 
  When he raises his voice in anger, glass shatters

         Effect: The willworker has a magical bond with a ghost within the immaterial state of Twilight. 
      Unlike a normal familiar, ghost familiars may not be embodied, though they can attempt to manifest 
     (The World of Darkness, p. 210), as normal. Even while insubstantial, however, a ghost familiar may 
     touch, and be touched by, the mage to whom it is bound. Likewise, the bound shade may speak with 
    the willworker and hear her words, without the need for any other magics. Ghostly familiars exist on the 
     material side of the Gauntlet, but can travel with their masters into Shadow, or go there themselves, if 
                                    they possess the appropriate Numina.

      The act of bonding with a ghost in this way frees the restless shade from reliance upon its anchors: it 
    may still travel to them, as normal (The World of Darkness, pp. 209–10), but it no longer needs them. 
      Even if all of its anchors are destroyed, the ghost remains within the material realm, rather than de-
    scending to the Underworld. Further, the ghost may now range as far from its master as a normal famil-
    iar might, and the familiar bond bestows a modicum of self-awareness upon even the dimmest residual 
    shade. Such ghosts regain a bit of personality (through proximity to the Supernally-fortified souls of the 
     mage to whom they are bound); enough to interact on the same level as a more conventional familiar.

        A ghost familiar spends and receives Essence in the same manner as a fetch, though the ghost fa-
     miliar can only gain Essence from its bonded willworker or through proximity to a place resonant with 
     death. The empathic connection conveyed by a normal familiar bond exists between a mage and her 
      ghost familiar. Likewise, the ghost familiar constitutes a Sensory sympathetic tie for its bound mage, 
                     and the willworker can spend the shade’s Essence as points of Mana.

                        Ghost familiars are built as fetches, with the following exceptions:

      • A ghost familiar retains its Virtue and Vice, and benefits from them, as normal. (Note, however, that 
    the ghost familiar’s Morality score, and any derangements associated with degeneration, are lost when 
         the familiar bond takes hold; the ghost no longer needs its Morality trait to function normally.)

                                   • A ghost familiar has no Influence or Ban.

      • A ghost familiar has two ghost Numina (The World of Darkness, pp. 210–2), rather than one spirit 
                                                   Numen.
        • As above, ghost familiars attempting to manifest do so according to the rules that govern ghosts, 
                                     rather than those for normal fetches.

      Among its other, potentially staggering,

    died or hold opinions about events occur-

  talk amongst their own (in most

 derworld, they discovered things that they did not 
 expect: inhuman things, dwelling amongst the dead. 
 These beings were powerful and jealous… and hungry. 
 Mages who dared to ask questions of them (and who 
 survived long enough to return to the living realm 
 with news of their answers) reported that these enti-
 ties had no recollections of having ever been alive. 
 In fact, the Necromancers who managed to make 
 relatively peaceful contact with these beings soon 
 realized that they much more closely resembled the 
 Specters of Stygia (see Chapter Two) than the shades 
 of the human dead.
   From that point, theories abounded among Un-
 derworld seekers and summoners, regarding the 
 nature of these strange spirits. At last, a consensus 
 among mystagogues and théarch scholars decreed 
 that these beings were, in fact, casualties of the 
 destruction of the Ladder to Heaven; natives of 
 Stygia that had somehow “survived” (so to speak) 
 the Ladder’s collapse. Perhaps due to their identity 
 with death, these creatures, alone, were capable of 
 weathering the transition from Supernal World to 
 Underworld, transformed, though not destroyed. If 
 such were the case, then they would, truly, be things 
 dead, though never born. Further, such entities might 
 contain within them the secrets of Supernal lore,

Sample Esoteric: Christie Wu’s Hunger
   The only thing on Christie Wu’s mind at the moment 
 is the fact that she hasn’t eaten since six o’clock last 
 night and it’s three hours past her lunch break, with 
 no sign that the phones will stop ringing long enough 
 for her to so much as touch the granola bar stashed in 
 her purse. Her boss forced her to work straight through 
 lunch, with a promise that she could run out to grab 
 a bite to eat at one, but — surprise, surprise — that 
 never happened. Now, she’s stuck on the phone with 
 some jackass who’s too damned stupid to understand 
 what she’s trying to tell him and all Christie can think 
 of is that Mediterranean turkey focaccia sandwich at 
 the place that just opened around the corner about 
 a month ago.
   When viewed by those capable of seeing into 
 Twilight, Christie’s Hunger appears as something 
 of a gruesome caricature of Christie, herself: a 
 pretty,  trim,  20-something  Chinese-American 
 woman, dressed in comfortable office casual cloth-
 ing. The esoteric’s chin-length hair is unkempt and 
 ragged, unlike Christie’s own, and its ravenous maw 
 splits her head nearly in half when opened, reveal-
 ing row upon row of shark-like teeth. The esoteric’s 
 hands are long-fingered, with curving talons, meant 
 to latch onto prey.

  trapped in the material realm; perhaps it manifests 
  at certain times and places according to some insane 
  calends of the Lower Depths. It doesn’t have a form. 
  Rather, this presence makes itself felt through the 
  rapid dissolution of any space that contains it. Walls

  interest, the Decay offers boons. If it is refused, it is

    If the Decay’s offer is accepted, however, it can grant 
  powers similar to Acamoth Investments (Mage: The

Chapter Two: 

                 From the 

     Five Towers

              “This is a bad idea.” Billy was looking at the walls, adorned with sigils. Time. Fate. Time. Fate. 
            And one other one — what’s that sigil?
              “I don’t care.” Tears were still running down Faron’s face. “I need her back.”
              Billy rolled his eyes, but he kept his face turned away from his friend. “Faron, even if you manage 
            to succeed at this, what you’re asking is impossible. If it were possible, everyone would do it.”
              “Maybe everyone does.”
              “Oh, man.” Billy rubbed his temples.
              “Billy, I love her.”
              “Then you should have stayed faithful.” Billy was sorry he’d said it, and he considered rolling 
            time back a few seconds to fix it, but Faron didn’t respond. He just crouched to the floor and sobbed. 
            Billy walked behind him and put a hand on his back. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.”
              “I’m not asking much,” whispered Faron. “I know I fucked up. I want thirty seconds of last Tuesday 
            back. That’s all I want. That’s fair, right?”
              Billy sat on the floor in the middle of the circle, facing the younger man. “Faron, listen to me. 
            I know you’re hurting, but please, understand this. You are fucking with Time now, and that’s a 
            bigger issue than you and your girlfriend. If you screw this up, hell, even if you succeed, you might 
            be changing things in a way that we can’t understand.”
              “I know.” He stood up and wiped his eyes. “That’s why I’m not using Time.”
              “What?” Billy looked back at the walls. Faron was right — the sigils weren’t for a Time spell. 
            They looked more like an oath, or an invocation, or—
              “Billy, don’t move.”
              The walls were changing. The sigils were coming alive. Hands emerged from them, hands with 
            delicate, pale fingers. Hands too small to belong to adults, but far too beautiful to belong to 
            children.
              “Faron, what have you done?”
              “Billy, I’m so sorry.” Faron’s eyes were bright with fresh tears as he stepped out of the circle. 
            “But I have to have her back, and you’re right, I can’t risk changing Time that way. So I had to

              Billy tried to pull time backwards, to run, to escape, but his magic failed him. He saw faces in 
            the sigils now, looking at him, hungrily. He had seen those faces before, during his time in—
              “Arcadia.”
              Faron nodded sadly. “Thirty seconds last Tuesday,” he said to the faces. “In exchange for that, 
            you get my best friend.”
              “Done,” whispered the faces in unison, and Billy came unstuck from time.

                                         Once in a Lifetime
     While the heart of the matter has already been summarized in the Introduction to this book, it bears 
   repeating, here: the central struggle of the Awakened is to be found in the Fallen World, rather than in 
  far-flung realms peopled by strange beings and alight with unearthly magics. This is particularly impor-
  tant to recapitulate with respect to the Realms Supernal, given the drive that many mages feel to attempt 
    a return to the Watchtowers and the worlds in which they stand. But the attempt to do so is a fool’s 
   errand. When, and if, a willworker is ready to return to the higher worlds, she will know; in the proper 
    time, nothing will need to be forced and the road to the Supernal will reveal itself. No loopholes exist 
   in the laws of the cosmos to make this process any easier. If they did, they would invalidate the entire 
                                            Awakened journey.
    Many mages may be tempted to treat summoned Supernal entities as some kind of “quick way” back 
  to the realms from which they hail. This is a perfectly reasonable mindset for such characters to evince, 
    as people who believe in higher purposes and higher powers often make desperate leaps of logic in 
    order to see what they want to see in the world (particularly in the World of Darkness). From a rules-
  design and (far more importantly) Storytelling perspective, however, it is vitally important that any such 
   efforts be doomed to failure. The Awakening is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for a reason. The Ora-
  cles, the Supernal Realms as a whole, or whatever it is that calls the human soul up through the Void to 
   the higher worlds, chooses those whom it chooses and then it sends them back . With all of their power 
   and incredible potential for knowledge, so many mages who see the Awakening as a challenge merely 
                          to return to the Supernal fail to grasp that simple truth.
      Supernal entities cannot open magical doors for mages that lead back to the Watchtowers, or even 
   to offer another glimpse, however fleeting, of them. They cannot exercise any otherworldly Influence or 
  rare Numen to get a willworker even one short step closer to going back to the Supernal Realm to which 
   she Awakened. They cannot thwart the laws that divide the Fallen from that which stands above, even 
   if those laws can occasionally be bent to permit them to descend to the material realm. They cannot do 
   any of these things and, just as significantly — if not more so — they should not. This chapter, like every 
  other in this book, exists to illustrate what mages can do in the Fallen World with powers that stem from 
  elsewhere; the ways in which they can affect their native realm, for better or for worse, proving that it is 
  not where willworkers go that defines them, but what they do with the power that they have been given.

Anachronism: The Perdurantist 
    A Perdurantist manifests as a two-dimensional image 
  of a man, composed of light and flickering like frames 
  of a movie through a projector. He appears to change 
  rapidly in form and shape as he cycles through life 
  over and over again, from crawling baby to hunched 
  old man. The Perdurantist is representative of change 
  throughout time, and has the ability to make objects 
  younger or older than they are in the Fallen World.
    A mage who summons a Perdurantist can ask him 
  to “fix” a broken Artifact. An Artifact that could 
  not ordinarily be repaired by magical means can be 
  restored by a Perdurantist. Rather than mending what 
  is already broken, the Perdurantist finds a discrete 
  moment in time when the object is not broken and 
  restores the object anew.

                                                        doesn’t matter. It invariably wins, and then challenges 
                                                        the mage to a “best of three,” and then best of five and

                                                        the Imp runs out of time and departs. Not surprisingly, 
                                                        Eshu Latieye appears in response to the summons of

                                                          If a mage can win the games, fairly or not, the Imp 
                                                        is willing to grant him luck in a future endeavor. The 
                                                        Imp spits into a small vial and hands it to the mage. 
                                                        When the mage wants the luck, he simply crushes 
                                                        (or drinks) the vial, and then may enjoy an 8-again

the Bull departs).

  affect the outcome, so there’s no reason not to do it 
  overtly. Playing fair requires contested rolls with the 
  Imp, with the dice pool depending on the game — 
  but the Imp gets an 8-again bonus, and isn’t above 
  using the equivalent of the “Evil Eye” spell on the 
  mage. The mage, however, can cheat as well, using 
  Fate magic to alter the games’ outcomes. This isn’t 
  considered dishonorable; Eshu Latieye thinks any

Totem: The Blood of the Prey
    Something must die so that the predators can feast. 
  Atavisms that take the forms of prey animals don’t 
  realize this; they simply want to avoid being eaten. 
  Totems that reflect prey animals, however, do under-
  stand their place in the circle of life. One such Totem 
  is the Blood of the Prey. It is a spirit of satiation, of the 
  end of the hunt when blood spatters the leaves and 
  the carcass is torn to shreds. As such, when it appears, 
  it takes the form of a prey animal. The Shaman must 
  kill it and tear it to pieces. The Totem then speaks to 
  the Shaman from the blood-soaked ground.
    The Blood of the Prey is a patient, if somewhat 
  morbid, Totem. It fulfills its purpose with its own death 
  (whether it rises phoenixlike to die again is a matter 
  of debate, and the Blood of the Prey, when asked, 
  doesn’t seem to understand the question). It might be 
  able to cure disease or stave off death in other ways, 
  or it might be able to mark a mage’s enemy with the 
  Blood of the Prey, making him a target for any natural 
  or supernatural predators he meets.

             And, still, nothing.
             Desperately, Cadence returned to the text, flipping from one page to another, wondering what 
           minute detail she had neglected. Her heart strained unto bursting to see Naimah’s lifeless body 
           whenever she glanced away from the page. Pale and still before the Moros, her cabalmate and best 
           friend lay, dried blood still encrusted around the two small holes in her shirt, through which the 
           fatal bullets had entered her left side. For months, Cadence had preserved her, just as she was when 
           she breathed her last. It was not within her skill to keep Naimah from dying, but her studies since 
           that night had taught her what she needed to know to save her friend from death.
             If only the fucking spells would work.
             With the cold reason of a Necromancer, she had diligently assembled all that was necessary. She 
           had seen a great deal of death since returning from Stygia’s Watchtower, seven years ago. Now, 
           however, her discipline was, at long last, breaking down. She shoved the grimoire away, causing the 
           fragile book’s spine to crack audibly when it fell from off of the desk and onto the concrete floor 
           of her basement. Two or three pages came away from the binding.
             “Why?” She asked aloud, “Why won’t you work?” Her legs trembled through each of the half-dozen 
           steps that brought her to Naimah’s side and she did not kneel there, so much as fall to her knees. “I 
           just want her back.” She took Naimah’s hand, terribly cold, in her own. “I’d do anything — anything 
           — just to have her back.” She looked to the damaged tome with a scowl. “You promised. You lied.”
             “No, Cadence, it didn’t.”
             The sound of Naimah’s voice was thin, somehow…  flat. Hollow. But it was her voice. Naimah’s 
           eyes were open and she was smiling at Cadence, again, just like she remembered. This was wrong. 
           She knew it was wrong. That ice-cold hand began to grow warmer.
             “I want to go home, Cadence. Say that you want to come home with me.”
             A tear rolled from the corner of her eye. “I’ve missed you so much, Naimah.”
             “I know.” The smile remained, though it never touched those empty, glassy eyes. “Say it.”
             The Moros drew a breath; the longest moment of her life. “I want… to come home with you, 
           Naimah.”
             Naimah sat up slowly, moving as if to embrace her friend, just like she used to. “And so you 
           shall, Cadence…”

                                                   Crazy,  
                                     No Matter How You Slice It
       Sitting back in one’s living room, paging through a book, it’s easy enough to see that trafficking with 
      the powers of the Void — Acamoth, Gulmoth, or whatever else — is a   bad  idea. Nothing the spirits of 
    the Abyss offer can even potentially be worth more than what a mage barters away to have it. In a very 
   real way, in fact, the denizens of the Void have nothing to offer, because that is the essence of what they 
      are and the totality of where they dwell. Their “gifts” are poison, afflicting the recipient with the un-
   bridled horrors of all that she foolishly requests of them. Why, then, does anyone actually summon such 
     creatures and bargain with them? Certainly, one can discuss the boons at stake, but that, alone, isn’t 
   enough. Something has to push a person over the edge of doing what can’t in any way truly benefit him, 
                             in the vain, mad hope that, this time, it somehow will.
       All save the most unschooled, wantonly ignorant, or improperly educated mage is well aware that 
   having truck with the Abyss is a sure path to suffering, but people — even supposedly enlightened people 
    — sometimes do things they know to be wrong, or even stupid, because they have allowed circumstanc-
     es to make them irrational. A man dying of thirst in the desert will likely drink any cup offered to him, 
     even if he’s aware that the water within is foul and unsafe to drink. Maybe a willworker desperately 
     needs or wants something and no other way to obtain it exists or, perhaps, he has to undertake a dif-
    ficult task and has an incredibly pressing reason to take a shortcut, just this once. Alternately, he might 
    approach the situation with the best of intentions: is it truly evil, after all, to sacrifice a mass-murderer’s 
            soul to the Void in an effort to save the life of an innocent child with a terminal disease?
     The answer to that question (and any other question like it), of course, is an emphatic, “Yes.” Anything 
   that the Abyss requires as the price of its services is wrong to give, and anything that it offers is wrong to 
    accept. That is the Void’s very nature. It is incontrovertibly wicked and monstrous to deal with the Abyss 
     and its natives, to be sure, but good people are sometimes hurt, confused, despondent, or simply pos-
   sessed of bad judgment. Through these cracks in the foundations of a human spirit, the Abyss insinuates 
                                          itself into the Fallen World.

                                                         any act of treason, particularly one that sows suffering

                                                         The Gulmoth accomplishes most of its works through 
                                                         negation; it cannot make the woman of its summoner’s

                                                         a single night’s infidelity. Also, the Prince can break 
                                                         Supernal-sanctified oaths through its power. At the

                                                         else. Lastly, the Gulmoth will work its powers to 
                                                         enable a mage to advance at the expense of a friend 
                                                         or trusted ally without requesting a tithe in return, 
                                                         though it will force the willworker to confront every

                                                           Tithe: As betrayal draws the Prince in Tatters, so, 
                                                         too, does it sustain the Gulmoth. For smaller services

                                                         more sizable bestowments, such as enabling a mage

                                                         offered up freely, so that the spirit might harvest the

                                             Aberrations
      Some of the manifestations, behaviors, gifts, sacrifices, and motivations bestowed, demanded, and 
  held by many of the Gulmoth described in this chapter are, to put it mildly, strange. Some of them don’t 
    even seem particularly malevolent — not inherently more  malevolent than many perfectly mundane 
     human beings in the Fallen World, anyway — but all of these bizarre thoughts and behaviors have 
   their origin in an unyielding hatred of all that which exists and the artificial strictures enforced upon the 
   Gulmoth by corporeal existence within the material realm. The shapes in which willworkers see these 
   entities aren’t their real shapes; they have no “real shapes.” They are fragments of the Void wrenched 
    away from the whole and compelled to take on hateful (and self-loathing) substance within a reality 
         that reminds them of nothing so much as all they, themselves, do not and cannot possess.
    Abyssal spirits engage in weird and inexplicable activities, and are subject to occasionally unfathom-
    able Bans, to go with their often disturbing and chaotic appearance. This is because they are, essen-
  tially, glitches in the system of the Fallen World: mad bits of nonsensical code inserted into a less-than-
    perfect operating system. As such, they reveal themselves in ways that sometimes appear internally 
   contradictory and/or exacerbate the flaws in the system they infect through their very presence. Mages 
  forget to their own peril the fact that the Acamoth and Gulmoth are nothing more than incarnations of an 
   incomprehensibly vast universe of hatred, jealousy, horror, and self-destructive lunacy, given material 
                            form and some semblance of conscious motivation.

Chapter Four: 

From Stranger 

                        Spheres

             Nine hours, now, and the scrabbling inside the walls still hadn’t stopped.
             Nothing was back there, of course; Munin had already confirmed that with his sights. 
           Near as they could tell, what was going on in there was the idea of a sound, specifically 
           aimed at the suggestion of something trying to make its way in… which was, essentially, 
           the case. The alien relic was in the middle of the sanctum’s dining room floor, right where 
           it had been when Clotho led the cabal in the summoning ritual. She left four hours back, 
           when she received a text message that shorted out her phone. She didn’t discuss what it 
           said, but departed in a hurry. Ten minutes later, Zephyr took off after her. Now, Danu 
           and Munin were the only ones left in the house and the scratching continued.
             When something hammered on the hatch leading up to (or, perhaps, down from) the attic, 
           Munin sighed, “I think it’s just about puzzled out the idea of ninety-degree angles.”
             “What comes next?”
             He shrugged. “Next, I suppose it’ll move out from infinitely small points and infinitely 
           thin lines, figuring out how to build dimensions by connecting points with lines.”
             “Remind me why we did this, again?”
             Munin scratched at the stubble on his chin. “To get whatever the hell it is that the Hier-
           arch’s been hiding from us, behind that massive two-hundred-year-old ward.”
             “And will it be worth the price?”
             At that, Munin looked off toward the front door of the sanctum, through which Clotho had 
           left and Zephyr just after her, and then back to Danu. Just then, the timbers throughout 
           the old house groaned, as though a great weight had slowly pressed down upon them.
             “Probably not.”
             Danu shuddered a bit. “Why did we let Clotho and Zephyr go?”
             Munin placed one hand on the nearest wall, feeling for the vibrations within it. “Let them 
           leave? I sent her the text,” he wiggled his fingers in the air, “knowing that she’d leave and 
           Zeph would follow.
             “Why?” Danu asked, incredulously, a note of anger creeping into her tone.
             “Because, six hours ago, the me from ten hours from now told me to, by transmitting 
           a message back through the flesh of the thing that’s going to arrive in twenty minutes. 
           We get the object, but we basically burn down the Consilium to do it. We just have this one 
           chance to stop it, but only if there’s exactly two of us here.”
             “And if ‘future you’ was lying?”
             Munin sighed again, more heavily this time. “Then we’re likely no more fucked that we’d 
           have been in the first place.”

                                               Story Hooks
      This “cargo cult” phenomenon is a good way to force mage characters into a small or large adventure 
     when they’re seeking an object of true power (or frankly, any kind of MacGuffin you want them to hunt 
    down). Any enchanted, imbued or otherwise Supernal Artifacts can be included via this manner. Some 
                                         specific story hooks include:
        • The grimoire is quite clear: there exists a crown with diadems of bone and a base of copper, and 
     this crown can confer quite a bit of magical authority to the sorcerer who owns it. The grimoire is also 
    quite clear that the only way to get a hold of it is to summon the “Flying Shadows” that “Give the Gifts of 
    the Supernal,” which necessitates taking a long trip to Vanuatu in the Pacific. If one performs the proper 
                       summoning, the Atakai will drop the mighty crown from the sky.
       • The Cult of Karaperamun (p. 147) has branched out. Members have been found in North and South 
     America, kidnapping notable civilians of European descent and dragging them back to their islands for 
      sacrifice. They get drunk on kava juice and sacrifice the abductees bound to great thrones that burn 
     as funeral pyres. They claim that in the last boxes received from the Atakai was a list — and on the list 
     were the names of those who must be sacrificed. One of the character’s names is on that list (or it per-
                             haps features the name of a loved one or confidant). 
      • “I’ve caught one.” The voice comes across over an MP3 recording sent to one of the characters — it’s 
    an ally or a confidant telling them he’s “captured” one of the Atakai, and he plans on “flying” the entity 
     back to the realm from whence it came. There, he believes he can learn so much  — will the characters 
                                   help him? Accompany him? Or stop him?

                                                           or simply appear at one’s door. Other times, they drive

Otherworldly 

               Compacts

            She screamed, her breath frosting in the chill winter air.
            Outside, the driving snow piled against the sides of the decrepit tenement, long since aban-
           doned by anyone with the option of being anywhere else. Despite this, however, Malice’s simple, 
           threadbare garments lay piled nearby, atop a rusty old boiler, still and silent; as cold as 
           the icy concrete upon which she writhed, every nerve in her body was alight with agony.
            The Gulmoth’s hunger was seemingly insatiable, gnawing away at bone and nerve tissue 
           with savage abandon. She chanted a mantra, over and over again, in her mind: This is what 
           I want. This is what I want. This is what I want…
            Every so often, a nearly unbearable spasm would make Malice’s body reflexively contort 
           in some way that enabled her to glimpse the small of her back with the gruesome, poisonous 
           yellow orb in her left eyesocket, and she could see the Abyssal spirit slowly devouring and 
           replacing her spinal column. When the first few rows of slender bone quills began to extend 
           down the center line of her back, the willworker shrieked again. Overwhelmed by pain, she 
           instinctively attempted to hide, her chameleonic skin shifting to same mottled gray coloration 
           as the floor. But the Gulmoth was already within her, and there was no escaping this pain 
           that she was now certain would kill her.
            And, then — just like that — it was over.
            Malice lay, unmoving, for several long moments, drawing slow, deep, shuddering breaths, 
           before rolling out of the fetal position and collecting her limbs beneath her. As she stood, 
           hot trails of blood ran from the scores of ivory-white spines protruding from her back and, 
           from there, down her legs, to pool at the soles of her feet. The willworker left crimson 
           tracks in the dust as she stepped around a tall pile of old junk, to regard the one relatively 
           new addition leaning against its far side. As she willed her flesh back to its normal shade, 
           Malice gazed into the full-length mirror, curious as to the results of her final chrysalis.
            That baleful yellow left eye stared back at her, along with the blue right one. Her 
           skin, while marred by livid scarlet stains, was still corpse-white, with a fine network of 
           translucent black veins just beneath the surface. She turned a bit, to see the bristling bone 
           quills jutting from the line of her spinal column; short at the small of her back and where 
           they protruded from base of her skull, and gradually lengthening to be longest between her 
           shoulder blades.
            She reached out to the mirror, delicately touching its chill surface. Fog quickly condensed 
           on the glass in a hazy corona around each fingertip. With her free hand, Malice caressed 
           her own cheek. A tear rolled from the corner of her right eye — the left was incapable of 
           crying. Ever so slowly, a smile curved her ashen lips.
            “Beautiful.”
            Malice heaved a blissful sigh.
            Finally beautiful.              Chapter Five: Otherworldly Compacts  169

fealty cost and almost always tied to the en-

In short, to gain the patronage of her chosen 
god, a mage is expected to serve; failure to 
do so costs the mage her soul.

              Background:  Mages  that  join  the  Choir  of 
            Hashmallim usually have a strong faith and a solid 
            understanding of Abrahamic theology and the Legacy’s 
             connection to the Christian faith. The one quality 
               that all Choir Masters possess is an absolute belief 
                in the righteousness and power of the Aether. 
                  Those wishing to join this Legacy can only 
                   demonstrate this belief through their actions. 
                     Less patient mages, only concerned with un-

                       this Legacy, though the laborious tasks set 
                        before them to prove their belief in the 
                         righteousness of the Aether frequently 
                          discourages such mages. 
                              These ordeals are not foolproof,

                          Choir is in its screening process.

                          Dominions travel where they are need-
                         ed, often taking up residence in locations 
                          where Abyssal activity is strong. They 
                          make it their mission to drive back 
                           the Void and weaken its influence 
                           in their home territory. Still others 
                           join cabals in areas where the Abyss 
                           is not a threat, with the intention of 
                           ensuring their fellows do not fall prey 
                          to the Void’s seductions.
                            Though no true hierarchy exists, the 
                          Legacy keeps in near constant contact. 
                            The Abyss is a danger of such epic 
                             proportions that no sane mage could 
                             hope to stand alone against its fury. 
                            The Choir’s fight is one that some-

Attainments
    The Legion’s process of self-transforma-
  tion is agonizing beyond reason, as the 
  mage  permits  summoned  Gulmoth 
  of the lowest order to feast upon her 
  flesh, consuming the metaphysical 
  template of the body part and adopt-
  ing a nightmarish mockery of it; one 
  capable of serving in such a capacity 
  and, further, granting extraordinary 
  abilities  to  the  willworker.  These 
  grafts become permanent pieces of 
  the  mage  —  gradually  regenerat-
  ing even if removed (or more 
  swiftly, with healing magic) — 
  as she willingly pollutes both 
  her physical and spiritual self 
  with the taint of the Abyss.
    Note that the Attainments of the 
  Legion, unlike those of other Legacies, 
  do not stem from a direct incorporation 
  of Supernal power into the self, but are, 
  instead, the result of the irrevocable 
  Abyssal grafts to which the willworker 
  subjects herself.

                                                    P’tak
        Description: Vaguely dog-like in appearance, the p’tak stands three feet tall at the shoulder and 
   walks on all fours. Its hide is a bald, mottled grey-green color, with strange squirming bumps that move 
    just under the skin. Each of the p’taks legs ends in a stubby, four-fingered hand, complete with oppos-
   able thumbs and steely-gray claws. The head of the p’tak is aquiline with a blunted beak filled with tiny 
                 rows of teeth. The dirty-yellow eyes of the p’tak are set in two rows of three. 
      Storytelling Hints: P’tak are possessed of limited intelligence and are mainly creatures of instinct. 
      Just smart enough to follow the orders of its summoner, when a p’tak becomes uncontrolled it falls 
    back into its instinctual hunt-kill-eat pattern of existence. Fearless, p’tak will never retreat in the face of 
     overwhelming odds, instead attempting to call more of its kind to aid it (see below). A p’tak sounds a 
   terrifying dissonant roar when it attacks; a noise that seems to go straight to the brain. If killed, the body 
                                    of the p’tak melts away to nothingness.
       Unlike most beasts from the Fallen World, a p’tak makes no effort to kill its prey before it begins to 
   feed. The creatures attack to debilitate rather than to kill and then proceed to slowly devour their victim, 
      feasting in such a way as to keep their prey alive as long as possible. Though unverifiable, mages 
   speculate that p’tak enjoy the sounds and sensations of pain and terror fully as much as they enjoy eat-
                                         ing the flesh of their victims.

       • The Color of Futility: The mottled hide of a p’tak shines a dull, yellowish color that saps the will 
    of anyone who stares too long at the entity. Any character who watches a p’tak for more than one turn 
      must roll Resolve + Composure minus the total number of turns spent watching the creature. If the 
     roll succeeds, the character suffers no ill-effects. If the roll fails, the character begins to believe she is 
      doomed and loses a point of Willpower. Any character reduced to zero Willpower as a result of this 
    effect falls into a catatonic state until removed from the p’tak’s vicinity. Each point of Willpower lost by

    a character is absorbed by the p’tak and it may absorb any number of Willpower each turn up to its 
                                                  maximum.
      • Fetid Humors: A p’tak isn’t made of flesh and bone in the way humans understand. The body of 
   a p’tak seems  organic, but alien humors run beneath what passes for its skin. Exposed to the material 
    realm by wounds, these humors react with the reality of the Fallen World in unexpected ways. Each 
    wound suffered by a p’tak increases its Armor Rating by one. P’taks never suffer from wound penal-
   ties and may spend one Essence each turn to heal a point of damage (always healing the most serious 
                                                 damage first).
     • The Spaces In-Between: An uncontrolled p’tak quickly reverts to its instinctual behavior, hunting 
   and attacking any nearby prey. Inside the mouth of the creature are sponge-like sacks that absorb the 
  blood of their unfortunate victims and stores it. Each time a p’tak bites a sentient creature (only sentient 
  blood is stored), half the damage inflicted by the bite is converted into stored blood, to a maximum of six 
  stored points. If an uncontrolled p’tak is outnumbered by its prey or stalks a creature obviously stronger 
   than it, the p’tak uses the stored blood and the Willpower stolen from its victims to summon more of its 
  kind. Once per day, a p’tak may summon others of its kind as an instant action that requires the p’tak to 
  spend five points of Willpower and three points of blood. P’tak summoned by other p’tak are considered 
  uncontrolled and it should be easy to see how a serious infestation could happen. Some rumors say that 
    if enough p’tak use their summoning power at the same time, they can open the way for much more 
                                 dangerous entities to enter the Fallen World.
     Because of a p’tak’s innate summoning ability, mages must be cautious in their battles with p’tak not 
     to present an initial threat strong enough for the creature to immediately begin summoning backup. 
    Smart cabals will hide their numbers from the creature, sniping at it from the shadows until they are 
                             sure they can kill the thing before it can call for help.
