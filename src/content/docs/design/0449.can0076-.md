SLIM-PICKINS: all right, you told a story
 your father told a story
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: mine's the truth
 
SLIM-PICKINS: all right, you and him and SIMON-BEEING were in the basement of the club
 
there was a fight
 SIMON-BEEING's cheek was cut
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: yes
 i was holding on to SIMON-BEEING
 that is how his blood got on my sleeve
 i 
told dad to tell the police that, but he did not want to involve me
 end of 
story
 
SLIM-PICKINS: so prior to that altercation, you saw KISSING-GAMES in his room
 that was 
it? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: nicholas, you need to be straight with me
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: (sighs) 
SLIM-PICKINS: were those the only two times you saw him? 
 are you sure you did not 
run into him anyplace else?
