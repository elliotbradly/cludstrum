This subgenre contains stories that rely heavily on the Comedy of Manners, 
which focuses on social commentary. 
Often taking place in an urban setting, 
this type of story will contain very little magic or fantastical creatures. 
Rather, it will focus on morality and social structures, particularly for women, 
sacrificing an elaborate plot in some cases to do so. 

Literary Examples: Shades of Milk and Honey, The Tropic of Serpents: A Memoir by Lady Trent, 
An Alchemy of Masques and Mirrors
