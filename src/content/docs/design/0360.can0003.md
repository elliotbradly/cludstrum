Daisy: I haven't seen much of you two lately
 
Eden: I just saw you at school
 
Daisy: Outside of that
 I got kind of used to hanging with you and your 
family over the holidays
 It's the first time Christmas hasn't sucked for me 
since my parents' accident
 
Noah: Well, hey, French club is going to that new movie about the revolution
 
Maybe you could sit with us
 
Daisy: I would love that
 
Noah: Cool
 Hey, let's plan it
 I'm gonna get our drinks
 
Eden: You can stop now
 
Daisy: Excuse me? 
 
Eden: This little act of yours-- poor, orphaned Daisy-- maybe everybody else 
buys it, but I don't
 
Daisy: That's just mean
 My parents are dead
 I-it really hurts when you talk 
this way
 I mean, I-I thought we could be friends, but you won't even give me a 
chance
 Do you know how sad that makes me? 
 
Eden: I'm sure you'll get over it
