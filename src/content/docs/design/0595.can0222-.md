PAULINUS-WICKER: you want to be legal guardian of CARLY-MARBLES's baby? 
 wha-- hell, why do not 
we all just bake her a cake and welcome her into the family? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: this is not about CARLY-MARBLES
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: it is to me
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: it


 (sighs) 
(cell phone rings) 
SLIM-PICKINS: pardon me
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: (sighs) 
SLIM-PICKINS: hello, REXXXX-LEXXXX
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: can you meet me for dinner? 
 we have not talked since my books were 
seized
 
SLIM-PICKINS: uh, yes, and there's something i need to discuss with you, too, uh, 
but i can not get away right now
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i will be working late in my office
 uh, see you there
 
SLIM-PICKINS: all right, i'll-- i'll call you to let you know if i can make it
 
good-bye
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: no, you know what? 
 i-i can not even deal with this
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: well, whether or not you want to deal with this, there's a baby 
coming, and i won't ignore that
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: yeah, that happens to be sheila and tom's grandchild
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: sigh-and-spin, and who better than me knows how sick those two were? 
 my niece 
has a better chance with me
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: do not you get it? 
 CARLY-MARBLES is gonna use this child to leverage her way 
into your life
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: i want CARLY-MARBLES to pay for everything that she has done, sigh-and-spin? 
 but the 
baby is blameless
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: SLIM-PICKINS
 SLIM-PICKINS, please explain to your brother why gaining custody 
of CARLY-MARBLES's baby is just insane
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: (scoffs)
