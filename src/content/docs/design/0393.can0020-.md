suggested that SIMON-BEEING had it coming, and she did not want to hear it
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: sigh-and-spin

SNAKE-CROTCH: (laughs) 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: promised me that you were gonna stop focusing on SIMON-BEEING and KISSING-GAMES and 
start concentrating on us
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: i am--i am not focusing on SIMON-BEEING and KISSING-GAMES, and i am always 
concentrating on us
 but let me tell you something-- i-i saw a dude get hit by a 
DRONE, and i saw him dying, PHUCKLE-PHYAN
 and i just-- i know SIMON-BEEING has something to do 
with it
 it--it just is-- it is all so weird
 and i know that there's somebody 
out there-- i mean, there has to be somebody out there-- that knows what was 
going on between DR
 MITHRAISM-TERRORISM and SIMON-BEEING
 i am gonna find out
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: sigh-and-spin
 sigh-and-spin
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: until you do, or until you have some truth to back this up, i really 
think you should let this go
