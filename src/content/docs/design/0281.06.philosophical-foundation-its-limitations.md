## A Synopsis of the Philosophical Foundation & Its Limitations in Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998)

The initial section of Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998) meticulously lays the groundwork for his innovative application of possible worlds theory to narrative. This section doesn’t simply present the philosophical framework; it critically examines its origins, core tenets, and, crucially, its inherent limitations when applied directly to the complexities of literary texts. Doležel’s careful deconstruction of the philosophical foundation is essential for understanding the necessity and originality of his subsequent modifications and the development of the concept of the Textual Possible World (TPW). This synopsis will detail the philosophical origins of possible worlds theory, its key principles, and Doležel’s compelling argument for why a direct application to literature proves inadequate.

**I. The Genesis of Possible Worlds Theory: Kripke and Beyond**

Doležel’s exploration begins with a detailed examination of the philosophical work that birthed possible worlds theory, primarily focusing on Saul Kripke’s seminal *Naming and Necessity* (1980). Prior to Kripke, modal logic – the study of necessity and possibility – often relied on abstract logical constructions. Kripke revolutionized the field by proposing a concrete, realist interpretation of possible worlds. He argued that possible worlds are not merely abstract logical entities but are complete and consistent states of affairs, representing how things *could* have been. 

This wasn’t simply a semantic shift; it had profound implications for understanding concepts like identity, reference, and counterfactuals. Kripke’s theory allowed philosophers to analyze statements about what is necessary (true in all possible worlds), what is possible (true in at least one possible world), and what would have been true if things had been different (counterfactuals) in a more rigorous and intuitive way. 

The core idea is that each possible world is a total state of affairs, a complete description of reality. Every proposition within a given world must be either true or false; there are no truth-value gaps. This completeness and consistency are fundamental to the philosophical conception of possible worlds.  For example, a possible world exists where you chose a different career path, but within that world, every detail – your relationships, your location, your experiences – is fully determined, even if different from our actual world.

Doležel acknowledges the influence of other philosophers who contributed to the development of possible worlds theory, including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who predated Kripke by centuries with his concept of “possible universes.” However, Kripke’s work provided the most influential and rigorous formulation of the theory, establishing it as a central framework in contemporary philosophy.

**II. Core Principles of Philosophical Possible Worlds Theory**

Several key principles underpin the philosophical conception of possible worlds:

* **Totality:** Each possible world is complete; it contains a truth value for every proposition.
* **Consistency:** Each possible world is logically consistent; it contains no internal contradictions.
* **Indexicality:**  Modal operators (like “necessarily” or “possibly”) are understood in relation to possible worlds.  A statement is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds.
* **Accessibility:**  Possible worlds are related to each other through accessibility relations. These relations determine which worlds are “close” to each other and which are more distant.  The actual world is typically considered the most accessible world.
* **Realism:**  Possible worlds are considered to be real entities, even if they are not physically accessible to us.

These principles provide a robust framework for analyzing modality and counterfactuals. However, as Doležel argues, they also present significant challenges when applied to the inherently ambiguous and incomplete nature of literary narratives.

**III. The Inadequacy of Direct Application to Literary Texts**

Doležel’s central argument in this initial section is that a direct application of Kripkean possible worlds theory to literary texts is fundamentally problematic. He identifies several key limitations:

* **Incompleteness:** Literary worlds are rarely, if ever, fully specified. Authors deliberately leave gaps in information, allowing readers to fill in the details. This incompleteness violates the principle of totality, which requires every proposition to have a truth value.
* **Inconsistency:** Literary narratives often embrace ambiguity, paradox, and even logical contradictions.  Supernatural elements, dream sequences, and unreliable narrators can all introduce inconsistencies that would be unacceptable within a strictly logical framework. This violates the principle of consistency.
* **The Dynamic Nature of Narrative:**  Philosophical possible worlds are static entities, existing as complete and unchanging states of affairs. Literary worlds, however, are dynamic and evolving, constructed gradually through the process of reading. The TPW is not pre-existing; it is actively created by the reader.
* **The Role of Interpretation:**  The meaning of a literary text is not inherent in the text itself but is actively constructed by the reader through interpretation. This subjective element is difficult to reconcile with the objective and deterministic nature of philosophical possible worlds theory.
* **The Aesthetic Function of Ambiguity:** Doležel argues that ambiguity and incompleteness are not necessarily flaws in literary texts but can be deliberate strategies employed by authors to enhance the reader’s engagement and interpretation.  A strict adherence to logical consistency would eliminate these valuable aesthetic effects.

Doležel illustrates these limitations with examples from literary texts, demonstrating how a direct application of possible worlds theory would fail to account for the nuances and complexities of narrative. He argues that the philosophical framework is simply too rigid and deterministic to capture the dynamic, interpretive, and often ambiguous nature of literary experience.

**IV. Setting the Stage for a Modified Framework**

By meticulously outlining the limitations of the philosophical foundation, Doležel effectively establishes the necessity for a modified framework. He doesn’t reject possible worlds theory entirely; rather, he argues that it must be adapted to account for the unique characteristics of narrative. This sets the stage for his introduction of the Textual Possible World (TPW) – a dynamic, reader-constructed world that embraces incompleteness, ambiguity, and the active role of interpretation.  

The first section of *Possible Worlds in Literature* is therefore not merely a historical overview; it’s a critical intervention that lays the groundwork for Doležel’s groundbreaking contribution to narratology. It demonstrates his rigorous intellectual approach and his commitment to developing a theoretical framework that is both philosophically sound and sensitive to the complexities of literary experience.
