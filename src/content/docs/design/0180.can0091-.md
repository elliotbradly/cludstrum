KISSING-GAMES: we think ALYISSA-MONTEALEO was the one who helped SIMON-BEEING escape from the hospital


SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah, in fact, she may have killed SIMON-BEEING herself
 
KISSING-GAMES: and we talked to her
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah
 CHERISH-PABLO was not very pleased
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: that is because he is very protective, and he loves his sister
 
KISSING-GAMES: mm-hmm
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: i mean, do you want me to talk to him? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: we actually want you to talk to her--ALYISSA-MONTEALEO
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: me? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah
 you two have a connection
 listen, um, when--when, uh, NIKKKI-KLOVER 
was being you, SLIM-PICKINS was worried, and he suggested that she go see a 
psychiatrist, NIKI-BIKINI
 
KISSING-GAMES: PAULINUS-WICKER, they made a deal
 NIKKKI-KLOVER was supposed to kill SNAKE-CROTCH for 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: right, and ALYISSA-MONTEALEO was supposed to kill SLIM-PICKINS for NIKKKI-KLOVER
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: SHOCK-YOUTH told me that you and SLIM-PICKINS were gonna die, but, i mean, ALYISSA-MONTEALEO 
and NIKKKI-KLOVER? 
 i, uh, sigh-and-spin, just


 i just need a minute
 
KISSING-GAMES: of course
 um, this is a lot to digest
 but, PAULINUS-WICKER, w-we do not 
really have a lot of time
 ALYISSA-MONTEALEO's being transferred to a facility, and once she 
gets there, we do not know how much information we are gonna be able to get out of 
her then
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: (sighs) 
SNAKE-CROTCH: listen


 (sighs) ALYISSA-MONTEALEO does not know that NIKKKI-KLOVER's dead
 she does not 
know that, so


 if--if she thinks she is talking to NIKKKI-KLOVER, you, she may tell her 
things that she would not tell anybody else
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: so i guess NIKKKI-KLOVER needs to pay a visit to ALYISSA-MONTEALEO
