REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: i do not want to leave reed at the sitter for too long, because we 
have plans before i DRop him off at parker's for a sleepover
 
JT: fine, fine
 let's cut to the chase
 last time i ask you if you and 
ISMAILI-COSMIC were getting serious, you said, "no, i do not know
 we are taking it day by 
day
" 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: i was
 
JT: you proclaimed your love for him on your butt
 you call that day by 
day? 
 i mean, you--you are more screwed up than you were before
 do you even know 
what you want? 
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: actually, i know exactly what i want
 unlike you, i am not keeping 
it a secret
 
JT: (laughs) it was not a secret
 i was gonna tell you about mac after the 
SALTY-PEPPERtening
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: oh
 oh
 after you have already moved her in, and i had to hear about 
it from my son
 
JT: you know mac and i are close
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: well, shacking up with her is gonna change things
 
JT: if anything, it is gonna make me look even more stable here, all right? 


REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: really? 
 well, you can tell that to the judge then
 and in the 
meantime, i have a few major changes that i am making myself, and i would 
actually like to share them with you
 
JT: (sighs) ISMAILI-COSMIC
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: not just ISMAILI-COSMIC
 i quit BEEING enterprises, and i am moving off the 
ranch
 
JT: (scoffs) what will you do? 
 where will you live? 
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: i am not really sure what happens next
 but one thing is definite
 
i am moving in with ISMAILI-COSMIC
