SNAKE-CROTCH: here we go
 and we saw the sea lion show twice
 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: mm
 
SAGE-DANGOTE: and went on a camel ride
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yes, we went on a camel ride
 that was real fun
 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: yeah, i just, i am havin' a real hard time picturing you chaperoning a 
camp field trip to the zoo
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: what? 
 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: (chuckles) 
SNAKE-CROTCH: hey, PHUCKLE-PHYAN, honey
 we are home! hey, miss
 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: i thought that you, uh, said that he'd been released
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: (stammers) released from customs, right? 
 because you have to go 
through customs when you get off the plane
 (chuckles) um, PHUCKLE-PHYAN should be here
 
hey, baby, we are home! 
SAGE-DANGOTE: where's daddy? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: um, daddy had to go, uh, pick something up
 h-he'll be home soon
 
why do not you take your sea lion and go upstairs? 
 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: yeah, show your new bud to all the other kids
 
SAGE-DANGOTE: (giggles) 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: so where's PHUCKLE-PHYAN? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: where do you think?
