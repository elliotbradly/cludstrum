  If ever a culture believed in essentially mortal heroes, how-
ever touched they might be by divine aid or descent, it was the
Greeks. They also absorbed influences from other cultures; for
example, Egyptian myths inspired Greek tales of terrifying ser-
pent monsters even in a land with no large native snakes. Greek
myths influenced others, including the Romans.
  In fact, the word  drakkon (snake) comes from the
Greek. The “dragons” in Greek myth often have the
nature of, simply, enormous serpents, devoid of the wings
and claws which characterize the traditional Western drag-
on. Some, like the creature guarding the Golden Fleece,
and Ladon, the fire-breathing dragon guarding the gar-
den of the Hesperides, were placed as guardians by the
gods themselves. They were natural watchmen because
their eyes, like those of snakes, never blinked. Others’sole
purpose was testing a hero, allowing him to prove his claim to
glory upon their scaly, twitching hides. Apollo slew the Python
that guarded the original oracle at Delphi before taking it over.

Three Heroes
  The Greeks may not have invented some major features of
the dragon myth, but the popularity of their legends certainly
helped to reinforce one or two of them.
  Perseus and Andromeda:  While magically flying
home from his quest to slay the Gorgon Medusa,
Perseus (pp. GR31-32) noticed a young woman
chained to a rock by a stormy coast. This was the
princess Andromeda, offered as a sacrifice to a terri-
ble sea monster. Perseus slew the monster and mar-
ried the princess, establishing a model for human
dragon-slayers thereafter.
  Heracles and the Hydra: Heracles (pp.GR32-34) slew the
Lernaean Hydra, a huge, lizard-like monster with numerous ser-
pentine heads, as one of his Twelve Labors. Its central head was
immortal, all its heads spat poison, and its blood, too, was dead-
ly. Furthermore, for every head chopped of f, two grew in its
place. Hercules’companion Iolaus seared the neck-stumps with

died. Hercules then buried the immortal head and used its blood     Jason and the Ser  pent’s  Teeth: The young hero Jason

the form and name of the gargoyle, the architectural water-spout
in the shape of a monster, and that the archbishops of Rouen
were subsequently given the right to pardon one criminal a year.
  Other French dragons include the shapeshifting draconic
poets, Jilocasin and Cercamon. The former was known for his
kindness, even adopting two orphaned children after their wid-
owed mother died. The two boys grew up to become knights,
and paragons of chivalry. They named themselves the Knights
of the Dragon.

             Ordo Draconis
     The Order of the Dragon was a semi-religious, semi-military
  order of knighthood, comparable to the Knights of the Hospital
  of St. John (Hospitallers) or the  Teutonic Knights. The Holy
  Roman Emperor created it in 1387 to protect Catholicism and to
  crusade against the Turks. The most infamous member was the
  Romanian Prince Vlad, named Dracul (Dragon) by his nobles
  because he used a dragon on his seal after having been inducted
  into the Order. Vlad’s second son, Vlad Tepes, “the Impaler,” is
  better remembered by the nickname Dracula (“little dragon”);
  see pp. WWi56-57.
     In later centuries, fraternities such as The Imperial and Royal
  Dragon Court & Order, claiming associations to the historical
  Order of the Dragon, suggested that the order had a secret occult
  mission connected with guarding the Holy Grail and Jesus’
  bloodline. These theories are wild even for an ersatz secret soci-
  ety, but in an illuminated campaign, there might be a grain of
  truth in them. Of course, the Order of the Dragon would be in
  symbolic conflict with the Order of St. George (p. 15), whose
  badge shows a dragon being slain.

Other European Monsters
  The Basque country of Spain had the seven-headed,
mute, venomous herren-surge (p. FB88), while Central
Europe had the tatzelworm (p.14). Finland has the malev-
olent ajatar (p. FB86), and Mount Pilatus, in Switzerland,
had an infestation by dragons, including one small but quick
and deadly creature which killed its own slayer by the intense-
ly poisonous nature of the blood which flowed from its death
wound. Most stories are straightforward variations on the stan-
dard dragon theme, although the variety of habits and magical
powers could be used to spring some surprises on wandering
dragon-slayer PCs.

Symbolism
  In pagan times, the dragon’s power, ferocity, and energy led
to its enthusiastic adoption as a military symbol. Dragons in
Welsh and Norse myths are dangerous and ferocious, but rarely
more evil than other beasts. Like any other fierce creature, they
made a fitting badge for a warrior (see p. 11 for the association
between dragons and King      Arthur). Norse ships, called

monsters, dragons returned to the foreground.

Dragons as Cute Pets
  Dragons were now in danger of becoming too
familiar, even cozy. One sign the dragon was in
trouble as a true monster, even threatened with
terminal decline, was the appearance of the
cute “shoulder dragon” – a creature with
all the traditional attributes of dragonkind
except size and convincing ferocity.
  To be fair, better writers could make
miniature dragons interesting. Steven
Brust’s Jhereg and its sequels, for exam-
ple, feature a small but fierce dragon,
telepathic and a very useful companion for
its hero. Still, this just literally shrunk the
dragon. Perhaps the most effective use of the
pocket dragon was deliberately comic: the irri-
table, incontinent, explosive swamp dragons of
Terry Pratchett’s Discworld (interestingly contrast-
ed with a full-sized dragon of very traditional
ferocity in one novel).

      Many legendary dragons required the sacrifice of a virgin
   (often a princess) as the price of sparing a mortal settlement. The
   innocent maid is a symbol with all sorts of connotations. In
   Medieval Europe, she symbolized the purity of the church,
   threatened by the forces of evil and ignorance. In Greek myth,
   she was the most valuable property of her father, the King. The
   loss of a young girl to a ravening beast could also represent her
   adolescence and growth into a sexually mature being, facing
   primitive and passionate forces within herself.
      Allegory aside, in most cases, the dragon has only two uses
   for the captive: she will either be eaten, or become a permanent
   guest in the lair as a servant or companion. In the latter case, the
   girl can become a political hostage for good behavior from the
   human community.
      Adragon taking human form might have other plans for the
   virginal thrall. She is a sop from terrified peasants to appease
   the voracious monster, and if that means allowing him to
   slake his human appetites on her flesh, then so be it.
   Perhaps the sacrificial victim will remain in the lair as a
   permanent fixture, to be killed if she ever fails to amuse
   her new master, or perhaps she will return to her village
   silently some weeks later, a hollow-eyed broken woman,
   never speaking of her ordeal.
      A feudal shapeshifter-dragon might request a human mate
   as part of his tribute, demanding a beautiful virgin of impecca-
   ble breeding for the same reason as any other aristocrat. If the
   dragon insists instead on perpetuating the custom of jus primae
   noctis (the right of a feudal lord to sleep with the brides of his
   serfs on their wedding nights), who would dare to argue?
   Certainly not the terrified young women who are escorted duti-
   fully to the lair, returning the next morning, maybe with a gift of
   dragon-gold, maybe pregnant with a dragon-child.
      See “Selecting the Sacrifices,” p. 93, for discussion of this
   subject from the human viewpoint.

Steampunk
   Dragons may seem too grossly fantastical for
steampunk games, even those featuring supernatu-
ral forces. However, this genre’s many strands can
draw upon fantasy and children’ s stories of the
appropriate period – some of which definitely fea-
ture dragons. And something about the classic
dragon image, with those scales of iron and breath
of flame, seems symbolically steam age.
   Whimsical games, and those drawing on chil-
dren’s stories, can use the slightly smaller dragons,
while those tending towards dark fantasy can fea-
ture powerful dragons played as cunning and fero-
cious monsters. “Lost world” stories – an appropri-
ate period subgenre – can also feature dinosaurs,
some a notch or two smarter and weirder than
would be strictly realistic. For a slightly whimsical
but distinctly steampunk dragon, see “Professor
Friedl’s Mechanical Dragon” (p.52).
   A truly steampunk dragon – a monster of the
Age of Steam – could be a glorious fusion of
mechanical engineering and esoteric technologies.

  Trying to create PC or NPC dragons
sometimes amounts to a monstrous task, but
not one that requires a hero. This chapter
includes many different racial templates
and guidelines for GMs or players to choose
between when creating their dragon. The
details of specific draconic traits – armor,
weapons, and attacks – are included in
Chapter 4.

         In fury, a Serpent wondrous, among the constellations of Urizen.
         A crest of fire rose on his forehead, red as the carbuncle;
         Beneath, down to his eyelids, scales of pearl; then gold and silver,
         Immingled with the ruby, overspread his visage; down
         His furious neck, writhing contortive in dire budding pains,
         The scaly armour shot out. Stubborn, down his back and bosom,

   Alternatively, dragons too powerfully link to the universal life
   force – their yang energy may be too strong, in Chinese mythic
   terms, or they may be agents of deities who disapprove of
   undeath. Alternatively, dragon corpses could be too big to gath-
   er enough magic to empower, or the undead-making magic or
   power could draw on the mystical energies associated with a
   human soul or human death, and dragons may not have the
   right sorts of souls or natures.
      However, GMs can bring the occasional undead drag-
   on into play if they wish. If nothing else, the visual image
   has become popular in recent years, and it never hurts to
   threaten PCs with something this potent .. .
      The simple but effective approach is to choose a tem-
   plate from GURPS Undeadand apply it to a dragon. (There
   may be a little fudging required, especially if one wants to cal-
   culate a precise character point total.) Broadly speaking, there
   are two types of undead, corporeal and noncorporeal, and drag-
   ons might become either. Azombie or skeleton dragon is, from
   the game point of view, just a very big and hideous killing
   thing, and is relatively easy to envisage. (For an ultimate
   devastating corporeal monster, a dragon practicing magic
   might become a lich.) A  noncorporeal undead dragon
   seems rather stranger. Even if dragons have souls much
   like those of human beings, the idea of one staying around
   as a ghost or specter may be just a notch too bizarre.
      For one example of an undead dragon with a rich back-
   story, see GURPS Monsters, pp. MO102-103.

   duces a full-powered dragon with the character’s full memories,
   which sits on its loot feeling possessive or depressed.
      The obvious problem in game terms is that most players will
   not regard this change as a problem. So separate the transformed
   character from society forever, and limit communication with
   other mortals. Cursed creatures may not always slink off to a
   cave and sulk for millennia. They could be slaves to higher pow-
   ers, required to guard treasure, or protect herds.
      This scenario could provide a background concept for a
   dragon character. While some players may only indulge token
   angst-laden dialogue between rampages, one playing to an
   Obsession (seeking restoration of his true shape) could be very
   effective – especially in a finite-duration campaign where being
   cured will represent a triumphant climax.

                 Malicious Magic
      The second “fairytale” dragon is the result of a curse cast on
   some tragic maiden or noble male by a wicked witch/stepmoth-
   er. The cursed creature becomes formidable and hideous enough
   to frighten everyone on sight, while remaining vulnerable
   enough that mobs or ignorant heroes represent a real threat. It
   loses most of their intelligence, and certainly the power of
   speech, but does not become a ravening monster.
      The traditional cure for this curse, again following fairytale
   conventions, involves finding love despite the hideous shape. A
   simple kiss or a more complex device may break the curse.
      This is best suited to a one-off, short-term scenario, whether
   the victim is a PC or NPC. A party, commissioned to capture a
   confused, terrified victim-wyrm in the wilderness, could deal
   with interference caused by the curse-placer and bring the wyrm
   unharmed to a handsome prince or brave maiden. GMs should
   use a template such as the small wyrm (p.  51) for the trans -
   formed shape – something just powerful enough to cause trou-
   ble, but without poison or flame breath. The transformation spell
   can be a variant Shapeshift Others (p. M25) known only to the
   secret sisterhood of sinister stepmothers. Aspecialized condition
   for removal is always more fun than the basic Remove Curse.

weight and 7 hexes long, usually lurks in river estuaries.
Unfortunately, it sometimes comes upstream to feed on
river fish, and uses its magical powers to raise the water
level as it goes, allowing it to swim further while flood-
ing the surrounding area. It may also attack fishing boats
to steal their catches – or to eat the crews. It can use its
splash power (a jet of water from its mouth) at reduced
power and range for a similarly reduced Fatigue cost.
While this jet is not concentrated enough to do serious
harm, it still does full knockback (based on double the
damage, this being a Splash attack), and may douse fires.
See p. FB87. 402 or 382 points.

Western Dragons
  The western dragon is the most common in European
depictions. It is also known, in GURPS Fantasy Bestiary
among other places, as a firedrake. It has four legs (with
some manipulative ability), two wings, fiery breath, and very
often, an attitude.
  Dragons vary noticeably in size, and grow from relatively
modest beginnings to awesome size over their long lives – if
they survive. Hence, the common features below list additional
details for each size/age category. The ages and weights for each
category come from the firedrake description in     GURPS
Fantasy Bestiary (pp.  FB83-84), and can adjust to fit games
where firedrake life cycles differ.
  The templates include the Unaging advantage because these
dragons never die of old age – they just get bigger and tougher,
although the rate of growth eventually slows. Of course, unlike Western Dragon (Common Features)

   Apatosaurus, formerly known as Brontosaurus(“thunder lizard”), is the
classic big, long-necked plant-eating dinosaur. A few larger species existed,
but Apatosaurusis impressive. An adult would be 70 feet long, and able to

campaign limits.

Animalistic Dragons
  This category covers animal-like dragons
motivated by instinct, needs, and desires.
They may be cunning, even clever, but
this intelligence applies only to
short-term ends. (Ahighly intel-
ligent but animalistic dragon is
a curious creature, both formi-
dable and slightly pathetic,
dangerously confusing for
human opponents.) Because
the combination of raw
power and lack of civi-
lized restraint is so fright-
ening, this type shades
into the “Malevolent” cat-
egory below, but the danger
is like a natural disaster, not
arising from malice. Such a
creature makes no use of
wealth; it may have an instinct to
collect shiny objects, but cannot
distinguish gold from gilded rubbish,
or understand what to do with money.

Benevolent Dragons
  Dragons with kindly attitudes are either small and
low-powered, or downright godlike and accordingly
unwilling (or unable) to act directly in human affairs.
Powerful, actively benevolent dragons that
were also friendly to humanity would tend
to overshadow the human heroes of
stories. A game with high-powered (or
draconic) PCs should relax this principle.
Benevolent dragons still tend to be austere
and forceful, with little interest in most human
concerns, especially if they embody some virtue or
principle.

  Not every dragon is huge, or breathes fire, or flies
– but most have several standard “draconic” abilities

GURPS rules.

flames. And when his sons were come

P   OWER                    I NCARNATE
  Dragons are generally extremely powerful (costing a lot of     “Flight,” in dragon stories, does not usually mean cumber-
points as characters, as seen in Chapter 3). This power can take  some levitation, but flight like birds – and predatory hawks or
various forms.                                                 eagles, at that. In GURPSterms, their move rates should at least

and are, in some ways, the antithesis of tool-users. Still, a drag-

down easily by other large creatures.
  Most dragons’sheer size not only provides muscle mass and
the ability to soak up considerable amounts of damage, it also
overawes many opponents without attacking. However, not all
dragons are noted for size; some, even in folktales, are surpris-
ingly small, and many have notably slender bodies. Dragons
display power instead of raw weight.

Scales of Iron
  Tough reptilian scales cover a typical dragon’s body, and sto-
ries sometimes emphasize the strength of these – it takes a pow-
erful or lucky blow for a hero to hurt the beast. Indeed, in some
cases, dragons are invulnerable, except for the underbelly, or
perhaps just one weak spot. (T olkien’s Smaug, in  The
Hobbit, is protected underneath by an encrustation of
gems from his hoard, except for one patch, though
he seems to be a unique case.) Dragons certainly
have the Scales advantage (p.CI57), but many have
better protection than even the strongest version of
this provides. As a result, it is easiest to buy Damage
Resistance and Passive Defense.

Mobility 

and Speed
  Dragons may be big, strong, and
heavy, but they are rarely slow or
cumbersome. They are often quite
fast, with a sinuous, serpentine agili-
ty; flying dragons especially are leg-
endarily quick in the air, and possibly
agile to boot. Dragons are not generally
known for speed, but being able to build
up to a fair move rate is another aspect of
their legendary power.
Flight
  The ability of many dragons’ to fly is one place
where the logic of science has to take a break. It is not
just that dragons are so big; it is their ability to fly effortlessly
and gracefully, twisting and even hovering in flight and carrying
significant loads. The ease with which dragons fly acts as an
indicator of how fantastical or gritty a game is.

              Rules Variations
     1. See Attack Enhancements and Limitations(p. 81)
 for rules for breath with greater or lesser range than the
 standard 3 hexes.
     2. Instead of using the standard “4 points for +1 to
 attack rolls” rule for Natural   Attacks, dragons with the
 Breathe Fire advantage can attack with the Magic Breath
 skill, exactly as described for the Venom advantage (p. 72).
 Attacks using this skill are melee rather than missile weapons,
 and do not take Aiming or Snap Shot modifiers.
     3. Other standard enhancements and limitations may also
 be useful. Costs Fatigue (p. CI110), Limited Use (p. CI111),
 or Takes Recharge (p. CI112) may help represent a dragon
 with “only so much flame.”

                Slavering Flame
     Burning liquid “breath” can be represented by a spe-

Hypnotic Gaze
  Although subtle mental effects mostly belong in the catego-
ry of magic spells, some dragons have a more instinctual sort of
mental attack, while others distract and confuse opponents with
their uncanny ability for persuasive speech. Mostly, this idea
comes from the belief that snakes could hypnotize prey with
their gaze, combined with the idea of the dragon as an archetype
of dangerous cunning.
  In GURPS terms, an appropriate knack or innate spell most
easily simulates hypnotic gaze (p. 77). Good candidates include
Daze (p.   M66), Mental Stun (p.   M66), Sleep (p.   M66),
Mindlessness (p.  M67), Loyalty (p.  M68), Charm (p.  M68),
Suggestion (p. M68), or Fascinate (p. G75 – very appropriate).
However, simpler or subtler effects can be quite effective
enough; consider Fear (p. M65), Panic (p. M65), Foolishness
(p. M66), Emotion Control (p. M68), or Enthrall (p. G75). The
nature of a gaze-based effect suggests spells should have a sin-
gle target, but powerful dragons capable of influencing many
victims at once could use a spell like Terror (p. M65) or Mass
Daze (p. M66).
  Alternatively, a dragon with subtle supernatural power in its
speaking voice can have one or more versions of the
Enthrallment skill (p. CI139-140). Such creatures could have
their own version of Hypnotic Hands (p.  CI141), using ser-
pentine body motions rather than gestures. Of course, aside
from Hypnotism (which an intelligent dragon might well
know), this skill has Trained By A Master as a prerequisite –
but perhaps older dragons study under mystical masters of
their own kind.

Venomous Blood
  Some legendary creatures are so deadly that their blood is
lethal poison. This requires some special rules. Buy such blood
as Venom – as a poisonous contact agent. If it is a contact agent
delivered by touch or in ranged form (if the Ranged or Cloud of
Mist enhancements have been taken), the creature’s blood also
serves as poison at a +30% enhancement (Blood Also
Poisonous). If blood is the only form of the venom and the only
way the creature can poison an opponent is by suffering a sig-
nificant wound then bleeding on them, it is a -70% limitation
(Blood Alone Poisonous). This may seem like an inferior form
of the Sweated Venom limitation, but blood can splash onto

  lizard that casts the right spells could do everything that the stan-
  dard mythic dragon does – and, by being explicitly magical,
  sidesteps any tiresome issues of physics or biology. In this sce-
  nario, even winged dragons use flight magic, instead of hauling
  themselves aloft with those flimsy appendages. Their wings
  could be pure decoration, “evolutionary vestiges,” or useful aids
  to steering.  While seemingly overcomplicated, some groups
  may prefer this possibility – it makes dragons interestingly vul-
  nerable to Dispel effects and low-mana areas.
     This type of dragon knows the spells Breathe Fire (p.M38)
  and Flight (p. M71), probably as innate spells or knacks. For a
  decent speed, it might prefer Hawk Flight (p. M71); dragons
  with just Levitation or Walk on Air might seem feeble. If the
  species uses wings to steer, that justifies a high Flight skill. In
  such cases, or if dragon wings are entirely useless, PCs could be
  shocked when a creature with a crippled wing does not drop out
  of the sky.
     For that matter, the dragon’s natural form could be relative-
  ly small, or could lack speed, strength, good natural weapons, or
  refined senses. It can compensate for those deficiencies with
  spells such as Dexterity (p. M26), Might (p. M26), Keen Eyes
  (p. M69), Armor (p. M76), Partial Shapeshifting (p. G11 – in

   only let dragon remains have impressive, simple uses if dragons

      Alternatively, draconic remains may have useful properties
   related to its original abilities – a skilled alchemist or master
   smith would be needed to draw out these virtues. A dragon’s
   tongue could contribute fire-breathing potions, or its wing mem-
   branes could make a fine cloak of flying. If item enchantment is
   rare in a campaign, any act of magical creation could require
   draconic ingredients, and dragon-slayers could find regular
   employment from magical artificers.

   dragons profitable to kill, then dragon remains may provide

    Dragonslaying Swords
      Given most dragons’ sheer power, any sort of enchanted
   weapon will give slayers a very welcome advantage. However,
   for heroes performing, or paying for, the enchantment them-
   selves, and for anyone with a sense of style, a dedicated dragon-
   slaying sword is especially appealing.
      In game terms, this requires the enchantment spell Bane
   (p. M45). It can augment the effectiveness of enchantments
   of Accuracy and Puissance, and those that create Dancing,
   Flaming, or Icy swords. When used against dragons, a spe-
   cialist sword may be more accurate, do more damage, leap
   from the wielder’s hand and fight on its own, or glow with
   flame or cold.
      Bane reduces the energy cost of other enchantments sub-
   stantially (to one-third of normal, if the magic is to work
   only against dragons), but no enchantment is truly cheap or
   trivial. Such blades may only exist if dragons are a major prob-
   lem, or the wizard or his employer has a particular grudge.  A
   dragonslaying sword might come with a story – or a legend –       True saints employ nothing but divine favor, subduing the

problem. Medieval storytellers rarely used these devices, at least
not before gunpowder’s appearance. Some of them would have
seen siege engines, but these were cumbersome contraptions,
barely moveable, with slow rates of fire, designed for battering
down walls over days instead of targeting individual living foes.
Siege engines could be useful with ingenuity and tricks – as far
back as Roman times, some tales described armies with siege
engines slaying giant snakes (p. 14).
   For games, this requires engines with a fairly flat missile tra-
jectory. Onagers and trebuchets, which throw stones in a high
arc, are impractical for use against moving targets. Still, if PCs
get a trebuchet placed and tested so that they know where a shot
will go, and can trick a large dragon into crossing that spot, good
luck to them.
   Certainly, in any game where clever PCs target monsters
with such powerful weapons, the trick demands a little tactical
ingenuity. First, warriors must move the “engine” into range of
the dragon, with a clear shot at a preferably slow-moving (and
ideally unaware) target. A typical small bolt-thrower has a snap
shot number of 20 and takes many turns or minutes to reload, so
the best approach is to site the thing, take careful aim at a fixed
point, and then trick the dragon into crossing its line of fire.

           Riding Oriental Dragons
      Chinese dragons occasionally permit mortals to ride on their
   backs, often as a great favor to someone who venerates them
   correctly, but this is dangerous for several reasons. Apart from
   anything else, if a rider touches a scale imbued with Yin energy
   (p. 62), the dragon could turn savagely on the rider. The rider
   must make a Riding roll once per hour. On a failure, he touched
   a Yin scale. Generous GMs may permit a roll against DX at -3
   to avoid the dangerous scale at the last moment (although a
   fright check may be indicated), or may make a reaction roll for
   the suddenly Yin-influenced dragon at  -7, giving the human
   some chance of charming his way out of the situation.

working for a dragon that takes just a few cattle and fights
humans only in self-defense is no worse than working for a
human nobleman. For that matter, even a real monster’s servant

  This and the next two chapters detail one
example of a dragon-centered campaign – one
heavy on “big reptile politics,” but also featuring
opportunities for action, adventure, and mystery.
The basic version is set in the Edwardian period
(around 1901-1914), but in an alternate history in
which dragons have returned – or perhaps simply
arrived. Chapter 9 projects this history forward to
the present day.

   What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God?
 “Thou-shalt,” is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion saith, “I will.”
   “Thou-shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold – a scale-covered beast; and on
 every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!”
