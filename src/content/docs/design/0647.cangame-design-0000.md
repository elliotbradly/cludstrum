Your presence is to run and animal perserve with neededing to deal with the poo

//CNN REPORTS: 
//JAVASCRIPT WILL BE THE FASTEST 
//PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD 

too much stress and you die

Play defensively.
Chances are your are going to be entrenched in a feeling of utter terror and awe sometimes as you encounter an alligator you have neve seen before
Be incredibly cauitous
Alligators are challanging and can be difficult at first 
HOwever the more you deliver the more you will notice there tales and behavior. Remember the more deliveries you make the easier it will become
You may dread busting a gator the first time but i gurantee the second time will be less frustrating
Just take notes and pay attention
to the monsters behavior
Do research a head of time
Your are never going to find where a monsters weakest to or takes the most cutting damage 
dont be ashamed to look things up online
Real life hunters research there quarry and game before hunts to determine the best bait and equipment
Learn what elements to use on the beast
figure out the monsters area of choize to rest or respawn
Every delivery person perfers a different play style

Do you like to use flash bombs
Do you take full adavatage of traps

Dont git spot
If git spotted hide 
Repeat

You have the calorie calucator 
Eat enough calories and you live
Do not eat enough and you starve to death

You can literatly live as another person
You have no control over when your piss or shit
You just hope that you do 

You could create amazing images
