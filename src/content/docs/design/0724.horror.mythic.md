A subgenre in which ancient mythology and folklore 
play a large role in the story, 
particularly the darker, terrifying elements of it. 
One way in which mythic horror is distinguished from fantasy 
is that mythic horror often takes place in the human world as opposed to a fantastical realm. 

Literary Examples: The Selkie, The Djinn, The Queen of the Damned
