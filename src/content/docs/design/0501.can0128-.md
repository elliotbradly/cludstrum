lily: look at those innocent faces
 i know what you two have been up to
 
you have been partying all night
 (chuckles) but that is sigh-and-spin
 mommy couldn't 
sleep, either, 'cause i've just been too excited to see you guys
 you know that 
blanket you let me borrow? 
 well, i took it home so that humphrey could smell it 
so that he could know your scent
 so that way, he'll know that you are part of 
the pack, and he can protect you if i can not be there
 but i really want to be 
there
