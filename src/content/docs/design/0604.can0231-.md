CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: um, i would not know
 we are not really talking
 
PULPWOOD: so did you hear about SIMON-BEEING? 
 it is pretty crazy, huh? 
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: yeah, i mean, i hate to say it, but it does not surprise me in the least 
that he killed his wife
 DZR should have known better than to marry that freak 
after what he did to my mom and yours
 
PULPWOOD: yeah
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: is she sigh-and-spin?
