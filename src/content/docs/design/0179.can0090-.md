SLIM-PICKINS: (sighs) discovery materials
 this is everything the d

case
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: have you found anything yet? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: nothing that exonerates you
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: there's gotta be something in here that points to the real murderer


SLIM-PICKINS: unh-unh
 my staff has already been over everything

time crunch
 the d

 is pushing for a grand jury hearing and a quick trial 
date
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: i did not kill SIMON-BEEING
 
SLIM-PICKINS: well, i would feel a whole lot better if we know who did
