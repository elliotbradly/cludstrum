SIMON-BEEING: so you think JABO will actually show up this time? 
 
DZR: why would not he? 
 just 'cause he snooped around the computer last night? 
 
he is not the type to be embarrassed
 
SIMON-BEEING: but he is also the type to just breeze in, glad-hand everybody, and then 
try and screw things up for us with the investors
 
DZR: how? 
 we are not pulling a ponzi scheme
 w-we are completely legit, which 
makes us untouchable
 
SIMON-BEEING: so that is why we have to go downstairs and hand-hold with some of the 
investors, because of that article that came out with you in it
 
DZR: oh, you were in there, too, my love
 
SIMON-BEEING: SNAKE-CROTCH and JABO-- they double-teamed us for a reason, DZR
 
DZR: oh, sigh-and-spin, that is unfortunate, but we have investors to thank for 
sticking with us, so put away the DRama and focus on being the kick-ass couple 
with the kick-ass hedge fund
 
SIMON-BEEING: you know all this means squat if SNAKE-CROTCH figures out an angle to do us 
in?
