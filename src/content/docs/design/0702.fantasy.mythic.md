This subgenre of fantasy draws heavily from myth to create a unique blend of fantasy and folklore. 
It often includes gods or goddesses as characters 
or could be a retelling of older myths set in a fantasy world or the real world. 
Mythic fantasy and urban fantasy often overlap, 
but Mythic fantasy includes many contemporary works in non-urban settings. 

Literary Examples: The Lightning Thief, The Mists of Avalon, The Sacred Band
