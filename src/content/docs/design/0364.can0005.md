Murphy: (Sighs) 
Kay: Oh, I'm simply-- I don't know
 
Murphy: Oh, hey, girls, listen to that
 
Kay: To what? 
 
Murphy: Oh, peace and quiet
 
Esther: Oh
 
Kay: Oh
 
Esther: Because "Hurricane Jo-Jo" blew out to sea
 
Murphy: Oh
 
Esther: But when she hits land, batten down the hatches
 
Murphy: Well, just wait till she hears about the test
 
Esther: What test? 
 
Kay: Oh, I asked, uh, Jo-Jo to submit to a D
N
A
 test to prove that she's 
the daughter I gave up years ago
 
Esther: (Sighs) Thank God
 
Kay: Now listen to me
 There's a chance that we may be related


 
Murphy: (Sighs) 
Kay: Although I, uh, I didn't feel the connection that I thought I should


Esther: Yeah, because she is nothing like you
 
Kay: Well, you and Chloe aren't exactly carbon copies, you know
 
Esther: Well, at least we both eat with a fork
 
Murphy: (Chuckles) 
Kay: Let's just wait and see what the test says
 
Esther: (Sighs) 
Murphy: Yeah, if Jo-Jo agrees to take it
 
Kay: Well, she knows, uh, how mistaken we were about Jill
 No, no, I-I think 
she'll-- I think she'll understand
 
Jo-Jo: Hey, I was hopin' you'd be here so you could say hi to my new friends


Kay: (Chuckles) 
Jo-Jo: Hey, gang, this here's my mama
 
Kay: Hello
 
Man: Jo-Jo told us all about you
 
Esther: I'll bet she did
 
Kay: Uh-huh
 
Man: You were right
 
Kay: Yeah? 
 
Man: This is a sweet, sweet spread
 
Kay: Uh, you know what? 
 Um, p-perhaps you and your friends would feel much 
more comfortable in a less formal surrounding, you know? 
 Uh, how about, uh, 
Pete's bar-- uh, Jimmy's? 
 Jimmy's
 Jimmy's
 
Jo-Jo: Oh, no, no
 No, we just--no, no, we just came from there, and, you 
know, we figured why pay for booze when we can drink here for free? 
 
Man: Yeah
 
Jo-Jo: Come on, gang
 Let's go get the good stuff
 
Man: (Laughs) Now you're talkin'
 All right
 
Jo-Jo: (Laughs) Yeah
 Welcome
 
Man: Whoo-hoo
 (Laughs) 
Murphy: How soon can you get that test? 
 
Esther: Hurry
