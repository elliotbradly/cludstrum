     reign of an early Dragon Emperor. Doubtless it once commanded
     an inspiring view over some great vista, but now it’s half-buried
     in a cave. The doors of the villa were torn off their hinges in some
     long-ago battle and lie blasted and scorched on the ground.
          Exploring the villa, the characters find a central courtyard. In
     the middle of the courtyard is a bronze statue of a rampant dragon,
     its head rearing back in challenge to anyone who enters. There
     is something curious about its eyes, which are like dark voids.
     Around the statue are broken cobblestones and dead gardens. The
     rest of the villa is either empty and abandoned, or weirdly missing
     as if whole rooms were removed stone by stone (and that is, of
     course, exactly what happened). The characters do find another
     curious thing—a stone trapdoor that they cannot open by any
     reasonable means. There is no handle or catch or lever to open it.
     The trapdoor is marked with the symbol of the Emperor.
          The statue’s eyes are made of some magical stone that seems
     to drink in the light. If the characters are exploring the dungeon
     with burning torches or lanterns, then the flames bend toward
     the statue’s eyes. If they’ve got a magical light source, then it
     grows dimmer as they wander around the villa. The statue feeds
  
  
  
../gears/13th-age/The Dungeons of Drakkenhall.txt :::: 241
  
  
The real horror of Drakkenhall, for me, comes from the idea that the ‘monsters’ that adventurers casually kill in offhand ways
during their adventures are people too… which makes the adventurers monstrous in the eyes of the population of Drakkenhall.
Of course that blurs the lines between ‘good’ and ‘evil’ which for heroic morally-unambiguous campaigns might be less than
ideal.
    Orcs are the exception. Orcs are teratic aberrations that live for slaughter and the destruction of all that is good and
wholesome, which is why the Blue doesn’t let them into her city.
    The slider is at your fingertips: you can set it to my ‘Dickensian London meets monstrous Ankh-Morpork’ with climate of
casual cruelty as a result of culture and poverty, or to Rob’s amoral ‘grand guignol’ horror show, or anywhere in-between. It is
down to your tastes and preferences and those of your group where you set the grimness of Drakkenhall.


    Street entertainment
    A Punch-and-Judy performer is putting on a show. The normal puppets are supplemented with a squeaky-voiced
Archmage and a googly-eyed Emperor. Much of the humor is scatological in nature or features crude puppet-on-puppet
violence. The crowd of goblin children sat around the puppet booth find it hilarious. An assistant circulates through the
crowd with a hat asking for those watching (or their parents) to put a coin or two in. Those with a 5 or 6 with an icon die
result the Prince of Shadows can spend it here to make the acquaintance of the performer who can get them a rare blade
poison (first hit in combat does an extra 4d10 poison damage); a 6 means it is free, a 5 means it will cost them 50 gp.
    A dozen skeletons dance, while their necromancer owner plays a fiddle. Passers-by throw coins into a hat at his feet.
Those who try snatching the coins will need to deal with an angry necromancer and her skeletons, and nobody wants that
kind of trouble.
    A fight between a pair of bugbear market guards has drawn a small crowd. It is a DC 25 skill check for the adventurer
with the lowest Wisdom not to lose 5d20 gp worth of coins to a pickpocket that is making his way through the crowd.
    A sign outside of a gaudily colored tent promises exotic delights await within, with two changeling dancers
performing on a stage. Adults admitted only. 10 gp entrance fee. One of the Blue’s hired thugs stands outside, guarding
the tent. A barker in a hooded robe and mask stands on a barrel, shouting about the amazing and surely life-changing
experience that await within the tent.
    Roll up, roll up. Argo the Giant will test his strength against all comers. 2 gp to have a go, a winning punter wins 100
gp! It is a DC 35 skill check to beat the giant in a test of strength. The barker inviting all-comers to try their luck is a one-
armed sahuagin.
    A tent with paintings in it and paint supplies and canvases on a table has a whistling goblin inside. The goblin offers
to speed-paint a portrait of the adventurers for 10 gp each (5gp extra each to make them look more heroic than they are).
However, the goblin (after taking the money), is hauled off by a bugbear guard to answer for some infraction of an
unwritten rule. This is of course a confidence trick, the real painter is away for her lunch— the goblin and the bugbear
will split the adventurer’s money once they are safely gone.
Food, mostly
    An open-air tavern is selling beverages and various bar-snack style foods. They do not stock dwarven ale or elven
wine, but do have dragon-wine. Dragon-wine is made from berries that grow on the ruins near the Iron Sea. The strongest
beverage they sell is fermented dog milk. The tavern owner (a tiefling called Shez-a-kah) hasn’t posted her prices, she
expects those who visit her establishment to haggle. Those with a positive relationship with the Prince of Shadows will
get preferential treatment here.
    A wandering merchant sells sausage-inna-bun from a tray around his neck. Once tasted never forgotten. 1 gp, or 5 gp
for extra condiments. A DC 20 skill check reveals that the sausage is mostly connective tissue and bread, with very little
meat.
    A goblin sells ‘specialty meats’ out of the back of a covered cart. The goblin hints that he has some ‘very special meat’,
that is ‘sweet’. A DC 30 skill check (or DC 20 if the adventurer has a relationship with The Three or the Orc Lord) reveals
that some of the ‘sweet’ meat is of their own species; if the cannibalistic nature of the meat is mentioned to the goblin he’ll
act shocked. Act.
    A culinary wizard conjures up sugary strands and weaves them into glowing shapes. 1 cp for a spun-sugar copy of the
purchaser’s own face, 2 sp for a small candy floss unicorn, 100 gp for a full size cotton candy owlbear that actually walks
about and growl-hoots a bit. Those with a relationship with the Archmage or the Priestess recognize this wizard as Sneil
Arfloop, a failed apprentice who lived in Santa Cora for many years. Sneil claims that he gained his culinary magics after
paying for the tutelage of a prismatic dragon here in Drakkenhall.
    A stall of live chocolate squid flops about unattended, with a sign stating that they come from the realm of dreams
(and that they cost 10 gp each). A disembodied voice whispers into the ear of any interested adventurer “Purchasers should
put their money in the jar under the stall, or be cursed”. Adventurers stealing a chocolaty treat must save (11+) or fail all their
skill checks for the rest of the session or until they return and pay for what they took. Adventurers stealing the jar of
money must save (11+) or hilariously, disastrously, fail all their skill checks for the rest of the session.
    Hurk Family Goblin Armory
    This interconnected series of basements and tunnels is packed wall to wall with almost every kind of weapon
imaginable. There are hybrid sword-axes, spring-loaded triple daggers, metal boomerangs, double-ended war hammers,
lantern shields, bohemian earspoons, bladed whips, and so on. The goblin family that runs the establishment are called
the Hurk family, named after their matriarch Granny Hurk. Of particular interest are:
    Bear launcher. This unusual device hurls bears, or other large animals. While adding an angry bear to a fight is rarely
a good idea (especially in cramped quarters) it can occasionally come in useful during sieges. Mostly the weapon is a
deterrent. The bear (or raging barbarian, maybe) needs to be loaded in and the spring wound (at least a standard action,

                                                         Art
                                                         While Eisen art is sparse and drab compared to that of the
                                                         Montaigne or Vodacce, it reveals a great deal about the
                                                         people’s inner beliefs. Most of their art is religious in nature,
                                                         and depicts calm, peaceful scenes. It seems to show the
                                                         world as the Eisen wish it could be instead of how it is.

                                                         Painting
                                                         While not as popular as opera, painting does have a

       buildings often merge into the streets that surround them,
       and a church may artfully twist into the garden of a nearby

       some colossal spider.

       The Spread Of Baroque
      As the baroque style spread outwards from Vodacce, it
       underwent modification in each of the countries to which it
       migrated. Different tastes and outlooks altered the delicacy
       of the original creative style, and true baroque merged with
       local traditions. In some areas it became more extravagant
       (notably in the fervent religious atmosphere of Castille) and
       in others it was toned down to suit more conservative tastes.   would instruct an

3.1.4    Wizardry
While Initiation to the Pillars is reserved to Princes, Wizardry is a relatively common practice
in Shadow. Between Chaos and Order, many a mage can draw Trumps or conjure Shadow
beasts, mold blood into creatures or forge powerful swords. In some campaigns, wizards
exist only in Chaos. In some, they have fortresses in the very Golden Circle, if they are not
advisors to the Court of Amber. After all, it is rumoured that the mad painter Dworkin has
been a wizard in a distant past. Or was he a psychoanalyst ? Or a priest ?
    The three main Ways of Wizardry are Trumps, Conjuration and Sorcery. While Trumps
and Conjuration are typically in the style of Corwin’s Chronicles, Sorcery is closer to what
can be witnessed in Merlin’s Chronicles. Also note that the following rules describe the

be achieved. Quite likely, different Wizards use different styles: think Dworkin engraving

               Historical notes

               Santa Maria del Fiore
           i
De’M ed ic




               The cathedral, started over two hundred and sixty years ago, was
               finished in the last century. It’s almost ninety years now that the cross
               was placed over the dome that Brunelleschi designed. Now, it seems
               that Vasari will be working on the frescoes as soon as he’s done with
               the Uffizi (yes, the biographer of the artists and supreme gossiper, but a
               fine painter and architect himself). Too bad for the façade, though. It’s
               still the plain stone of old times, and nobody really likes it—but nobody
               knows how to fix it.

               Santa Croce

               Santa Croce is the greatest Franciscan church in the world. It holds
               several chapels, some decorated by Giotto, and it’s connected to the
               Franciscan convent. The refectory, which holds the Crucifix by Cimabue,
               is undergoing repairs after the 1557 flood. In the last two centuries the
               Franciscan have held the role of inquisitors in the city.

               Opera del Duomo

               The cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore has been completed over a century
               ago, but work isn’t over—someone has to maintain the buildings, create
               new statues and oversee the works. The Opera del Duomo does all
               that, and gives artists workspace, as it did over fifty years ago with
               Michelangelo for his David.

               Loggia dei Lanzi

               A building with wide arches opening on Piazza della Signoria; not more
               than ten years ago, Cosimo used this lodge to showcase a massive whale
               caught in the waters of Livorno. He has also commissioned an allegorical
               statue of Perseus to Cellini, and it now overlooks the piazza, with its
               bronze serpents reminding the citizen of the pitfalls of the Republic.

Glass Bead Game: The Basic Idea...
            The Glass Bead Game is thus a mode of playing with the total
            contents and values of our culture; it plays with them as, say, in
            the great age of the arts a painter might have played with the
            colors on his palette. All the insights, noble thoughts, and works of
            art that the human race has produced in its creative eras, all that
            subsequent periods of scholarly study have reduced to concepts and
            converted into intellectual values the Glass Bead Game player
            plays like the organist on an organ. And this organ has attained
            an almost unimaginable perfection; its manuals and pedals range
            over the entire intellectual cosmos; its stops are almost beyond
            number. Theoretically this instrument is capable of reproducing
            in the Game the entire intellectual content␣ of the universe.
            — Hermann Hesse, Magister Ludi




            Pythagoras playing a bead game?

            From Gregor Reisch, Margarita
            philosophica (Freiburg, 1503).
                The first Nobel Prize for Game Design?
                The German Swiss novelist Hermann Hesse received the Nobel Prize for
                Literature in 1946 for his novel, Magister Ludi... You could say that the first
                Nobel for a Web-based computer game design was awarded to Hesse. It’s not
                strictly accurate — but it does get a point across: that the design for a game,
                the “Glass Bead Game”, was central to Hesse’s book.

                It is not, I think, surprising that such a game should have drawn the enthusiastic
                interest of Hesse’s fellow Nobel laureates, Thomas Mann, who refers to his
                own novel Doctor Faustus as a “glass bead game with black beads,” and Manfred
                Eigen, who wrote his book Laws of the Game: How the Principles of Nature Govern
                Chance “to translate Hermann Hesse’s symbol of the glass-bead game back
                into reality”.

                       Wilson of Computer Gaming World from the games industry and others, and
                       bring together those who are interested in the GBG as a metaphor, GBG
                       designers and players, interested scholars, researchers, software developers and
                       non-GBG game designers to read papers, compare notes, and play the various
                       GBG variants now available.

                       The Conference should immeasurably strengthen the GBG designers’
                       community which already exists: and our hope would be that in addition to the
                       cross-fertilization of ideas and networking of projects which it would facilitate,
                       it might lead to the exploration of other avenues for GBG development:


                       The Institute of Glass Bead Game Studies
                       Most important of these would be the organization, in an academic setting, of
                       an Institute of Glass Bead Game Studies. We envision this Institute exploring
                       the cultural, metaphorical, semiotic, and scientific implications of playable Glass
                       Bead Games and their uses in education and therapy, as well as topics in Hesse
                       scholarship.

                       One major Institute project would be the design of a complete suite of GBG
                       software to John Holland’s specifications, a project in which Dr. Holland himself
                       has expressed keen interest, and which he estimates might take two or three
                       years work by a core-group of computer scientists.


                       The Glass Bead Game Journal and Monograph Series
                       The GBG Journal, a refereed cross-disciplinary academic journal, would carry
                       the proceedings of the first GBG Conference in its first issue, and thereafter
                       explore the same range of topics as the Institute. More extended studies could
                       be published in a Monograph Series.

                       According to Professor Gunther Gottschalk of UC Santa Barbara, who has
                       been in contact with them, the Feustel-Bucherer family in Switzerland possess
                       a game built by Hesse’s friend the painter Max Bucherer, incorporating the
                       work of Bucherer’s wife, Als Feustel — whose theory of the correspondences
                       between the musical and color scales Hesse himself mentions in his novel.

      but this is no   HipBone would very much like to see an Institute graduate student — hopefully
more than an aside,    under Professor Gottschalk’s guidance — make further contact with the Feustel-
  a footnote, and a    Bucherer family and write up a scholarly study of this Game, and of Als Feustel’s
           dream...    theory of the correspondences. Such a study would be an impressive first
                       publication for the Institute: while the Institute, Journal and Monograph Series
                       together would constitute a long-overdue and proper homage to Hesse himself.

       NOW IS THE TIME to pursue a designer’s dream: when
       large publishers desire quality content and actively seek
       independent groups that demonstrate both a vision and a
       plan. For those whose business is the creation of worlds,
       development is returning to the heady days of the mid-
       1980s, when a few people with a garage and a vision
       really could revolutionize the computer gaming industry.

gyros . . .” she said.

 The guys eyed each other. “Well, there’s a reason there’s only one set of gyros,” Mick said. “You get
two sets and they can argue with each other, end up working against each other. Anyway, in the spin-up
checklist, we’ve addedSYNCHRONIZE GYROS .”

“And if you take a knock or a hard hit, the gyros can go out of sync, so you may have to resync them.
Nothing we can do about that,” Sven said, scuffing the toe of his boot on the floor.

 “That’s why we insist that only the smart ones operate the ’Mechs,” Grace said, then took the guys off
the hook. “Okay, we’ve got good armor, but I’d kind of like to do something nasty to the raiders.
Throwing dirt clods isn’t the fun it used to be when I was ten and trying to get even with the boys.”

“Oh, you haven’t heard,” Sven said.

“No, she hasn’t heard,” Mick agreed.

“What haven’t I heard?”

 “We’ve got two things up our sleeves,” Mick said. “Sven here brought in everything we need to make a
nifty thirty-millimeter Gatling gun. Not as fancy as an autocannon, but something we can make here.
Johnny Shepherd, our gunsmith, came up with a caseless shell that feeds real nice and lets us keep the
machinery pretty simple.”

“Caseless, no brass,” Grace said, trying to think fast.

“Yeah, we don’t got a lot of brass,” Mick said.

Grace frowned. “But if you’re using glue or something to hold the propellant together . . .”

“It kind of gums up the works,” Sven agreed. “Gatlings are pretty forgiving, but we’ll have to clean ’em
good after a fight.”

This whole lash-up was one compromise after another, but Mick was still grinning. “A painter drove in

yesterday. Brought a whole load of paint with him.”

“So now we can paint the ’Mechs?”

“Yes, but not with his stuff. His aluminum powders are going straight into the explosives mill,” Sven said.

“I don’t think the girl understands you,” Mick said.

 “Aluminum is great for sheeting,” Sven said. “In a fine powder, it gives paint that silver look that lasts and
lasts. But aluminum powder makes great rocket propellant, too. Mix it with the stuff coming out of the
Kilkenny fertilizer plant, and we’ve got power for medium-range rockets. The painter knows a chemist
with a magnesium supply. I think we’ll have everything we need for shaped charges on our rockets. I
know you look at every new joe who walks in as another mouth to feed, but some are bringing in the
know-how we need to equip a damn fine army, ma’am.”

 Three days before the DropShip was due, Grace called a supper meeting at her home for her leadership
crew. To the seven mercs, she added Wilson, Ho, Laird and Mick. Chato and Jobe saw to their own
interests. The composition wasn’t exactly representative, but at least there was no bickering over rules.
They knew why they were here. With luck, they’d all agree on what they were going to do.

Done with one of Mother’s great meals and ready to move to business, Grace turned to Wilson. “Did
you bring them?”

“Signed, sealed and attested to. All registered at the courthouse,” he said, handing Grace a folder.

enough to sign on to train us. To fight with us. I want to personally thank you for that.” The muttering

 Grace stood, and let her eyes rest on each of the six MechWarriors at her table. “All of you were kind
enough to sign on to train us. To fight with us. I want to personally thank you for that.” The muttering
around the table told her it was nothing, just their job. Ben eyed her quietly.

“We, the people of Falkirk, want to thank you. We have a saying: ‘Words are cheap. Land is forever.’
So I’m not going to say a lot, just give these to you.” She walked around the table, placing before each
warrior a deed for six hundred and forty acres of prime foothill land. “If you want to farm, there’s good
bottom land and water on each of these. Wil, there is water, isn’t there?”

 “I checked each plot,” Wilson said. “There’s enough water there to support a good herd. If not, bring
that deed back to me and I’ll personally swap it for any square mile of land I have.”

 “There’s also solid rock under the hills above your farmland. There’s no way to tell, but most every hill
around here has some valuable minerals in it. As for petrocarbons, you’ll just have to take your chances
with the rest of us.”

 Grace paused back at her chair. “I know you are warriors, and land may not mean the same to you that
it does to me. But this is the best that I have to give you . . . this land that we stand on . . . and my

Name: Ardan Sortek
Title: Colonel, Knight Excalibur, Member of the Order of
Davion
Position: Military Advisor to Prince Hanse Davion
Birthplace: Sortek Hall, New Avalon
Age: 32
Sex: Male

Distinguishing Physical Characteristics:
     Ardan Sortek is a slim man of muscular build and roughhewn,
square features. Though strong in physique, he can be quick
and graceful, especially in a fight. Sortek wears his brown hair
short, which reveals the thin scar above his right eyebrow that
he picked up in a ‘Mech training accident. His left wrist was in-
jured in an action against a Capellan ‘Mech, leaving it with lim-
ited mobility.

Brief Personal History:
      Ardan Sortek was born into a military family. His father, Major
Adriaan Sortek (retired), was a famous battalion commander in
the 134th New Avalon Tank Regiment attached to the First Royal
Guards RCT. He once saved Prince Andrew’s life during an RCT
action against the Capellan Confederation. In gratitude, the
Davion family gave Adriaan the title of Baron of Crossroads Prairie
on New Avalon. Prince Andrew and Adriaan were close friends
until the time of the Prince’s death in 2999.
      Because of their fathers, Hanse Davion and Ardan Sortek
also became friends, and at one point, the two were almost in-
separable despite the ten-year difference in their ages. Their
friendship survived even after Hanse left New Avalon to pursue
a military and political career.

         Marik forces dominated the Seventh SLDF Corps that made up the Canopus thrust, commanded by Marion Marik, Albert’s daughter and the new
     Captain-General. Leaving political management of the League in Parliament’s hands, she waged a bitter campaign, pitting Free Worlds League tech-

destruction of the Canopian fleet at Thurrock opened the door to Canopus, and Marion captured the Magistracy capital in early 2584. Securing the
entire Magistracy took another four years, and thirteen more would pass before all the Periphery realms were subdued.
     Unlike some House forces involved in other Star League campaigns, Marion Marik came to respect her Periphery opponents. Despite consid-
erable casualties on both sides, she made sure her personnel treated prisoners well. She left many Canopian institutions intact, establishing the
Star League as an over-arching authority rather than seizing direct governance. This preservation of Canopian society, together with Marion’s
insistence on the honors of war, did much to ensure a good working relationship between Canopus, the Free Worlds and the Star League. Melissa
Humphreys, the administrator appointed to oversee the reconstruction of Canopus, took a similarly enlightened approach, encouraging her par-
ent government to pour massive investments into its neighbor. Seeing an opportunity for profit, Parliament—and League businesses—readily

CONCEPT AND PLANNING
   Before you grab any tools and start cutting up miniatures,
you need a concept and a plan of action. Decide what your
finished product is, what your starting point will be and
what parts, tools and techniques are necessary to complete
the project. Below are a few sample kitbashing projects that
we’ll describe throughout this section. Additional details and
techniques for these projects will appear in later sections.

    upon the noble community of Bet Bireli like a plague. None could

of the artist’s skill, and how each family had some portrait or other
commissioned to his brush. My companions and I never anticipated a
meeting with the artist, until the fortnight he refused to appear for any
clients and we were ourselves commissioned to investigate his absence.

finish of his latest work – a large painting of an unnamed monster
he had seen lightly sketched in some dark book and was
determined to re-create. I tell you truth, a mere glimpse of his
artistry was enough to make the blood curdle. The creature was
over two heads taller than I, staring out at us from an oversized
canvas lit only by dim candlelight. Its wide, staring black eyes
seemed totally devoid of soul. The emaciated, hunched body
wore dark-green skin like parchment in its tautness over ribs, an
eruption of warts covering all flesh. The mouth was a cavern of
sharpened, gnashing teeth beneath a large nose, and a hint of blood
showed on its sharpened claws. It was hideous, filled with an almost
palpable aura of danger.
  Even as I stared in shock, I unthinkingly slipped my hand onto my
crossbow. I doubt not that had the wind shifted the canvas, my frayed
nerves would have shot a bolt straight into it. I eyed my friends, and saw
they were no better than I. Fright and disgust stood on each face. My
halfling friend, whom I soon learned had personal experience of the creature,
was worst. His hands were twitching, his eyes were like bright glass, his face bleached and
drawn. “Troll,” he stammered, and quickly retreated from the room. -w                         Be sure to burn all troll flesh, even the smallest scrap!

      be no direct confrontation with such beings; instead,
      the PCs should uncover only evidence and hints—the
      smell of brimstone, a cloven hoof print, a scrawled

         Direct confrontation and confirmation of such
      creatures should occur only after the PCs work to
      locate, surprise, or trap such a being. Even then,
      the confrontation should be brief and terrifying.
      Remember, the longer and better understood a threat
      is, the less frightening it is. In any case, the GM should
      work to keep the truth from the players long enough to
      construct a mystery that’s worth solving.

    “I’m pretty sure he’s dead. He must be dead.” Aline was crying, and Jeremy was watching out the
window of the house. The room was dark. Flickering static from the TV cast crazy, staccato shadows on the
wall. The three teens were gathered near the storm door, near the bay window that looked out on the lawn.

their skin moist whenever they were out of the water. The mouth of a zuxu was long and pointed, and was filled with sharp teeth. Their

supported little aquatic life. (ND, COG)

Ability, divine favour, experience, fate, luck, and sorcery can all factor in the saving throw attempt. Each character
class has SV modifiers; these are noted at the respective class entries. Also, dexterity, constitution, and wisdom
scores can impact saving throws (see ATTRIBUTES, dexterity, constitution, and wisdom). For more information
on the function and use of the saving throw, refer to VOL. III, SAVING THROW.

BACKGROUND
Of course, every player character must have a name, perhaps inspired by historical or fictional resources.
Some players may invent names from whole cloth, whilst others might create anagrams of their own names.
Depending on the style and preference of play, further information may be developed, including character
background and personality. Such might entail the character’s place of origin, general outlook, and behaviour.
Place of origin need not be specific; one might simply say “a small farming village”, or “a busy port city”, and
so on. Ideally, your character’s personality is governed by his charisma score, character class, alignment,
background, and secondary skills (q.v.).

SECONDARY SKILLS: Professional or trade skills typically developed from childhood to adolescence. They
may have little overlap with the character’s class, oft attributed to environment, upbringing, socio-œconomic
status, and culture; e.g., the son of a potter likely is learned in the same craft, unless his father sent him to
apprentice with his uncle, the saddler. So, a cleric may once have been a brewer of fine spirits, a thief may have
been a baker, a fighter may have served as a butcher’s apprentice, and a magician may have experience as a
cobbler.

Roll a d6 (for the column), followed by a d20 (for the row), to randomly determine a secondary skill—or, with
referee approval, simply select one. This list is hardly representative of all professions possible, but is suitable
for game purposes. Specifics regarding a trade or profession may be developed: A miner might be a coal miner,
copper miner, lead miner, or salt miner; an animal trainer might be a dog trainer, horse trainer, or mammoth
trainer. Furthermore, if a result such as “limner / painter / sculptor” is generated, one might simply opt to have
some background in sculpting, not necessarily all three art forms.

background, and secondary skills (q.v.).

SECONDARY SKILLS: Professional or trade skills typically developed from childhood to adolescence. They
may have little overlap with the character’s class, oft attributed to environment, upbringing, socio-œconomic
status, and culture; e.g., the son of a potter likely is learned in the same craft, unless his father sent him to
apprentice with his uncle, the saddler. So, a cleric may once have been a brewer of fine spirits, a thief may have
been a baker, a fighter may have served as a butcher’s apprentice, and a magician may have experience as a
cobbler.

Roll a d6 (for the column), followed by a d20 (for the row), to randomly determine a secondary skill—or, with
referee approval, simply select one. This list is hardly representative of all professions possible, but is suitable
for game purposes. Specifics regarding a trade or profession may be developed: A miner might be a coal miner,
copper miner, lead miner, or salt miner; an animal trainer might be a dog trainer, horse trainer, or mammoth
trainer. Furthermore, if a result such as “limner / painter / sculptor” is generated, one might simply opt to have
some background in sculpting, not necessarily all three art forms.

LANGUAGE: Every character begins play with knowledge of the “Common” tongue and possibly a native
language if of a specific racial derivation. Bonus languages due to high intelligence (see ATTRIBUTES,
intelligence) are possible, and additional languages may be learnt through campaign play; e.g., a Kimmerian
who spends three years in an Ixian prison is likely to pick up the Thracian (Ixian) tongue.

When selecting a language, a specific dialect must be chosen. One cannot simply select Hellenic; one must
specify a Hellenic dialect, such as Hellenic (Amazon). Of course, all the dialects of a language group will have
commonalities, but the written forms may exhibit significant differences. Note that Old Norse is an exception,
as it has but a single form.

CASTLE and STRONGHOLD PERSONNEL: Lords (knights, barons, chieftains, etc.) must retain the service
of several worker types within and without the walls of the castle or stronghold. Their number and composition
will vary; typically, personnel are of similar race, alignment, and religion as the lord, though exceptions are
possible. For example, within the domain of the City-State of Khromarium, a Keltic warlord from the Gal Hills
might be granted the right to establish a stronghold whose personnel are largely composed of mixed-lineage
(common) men.

Free Settlers: When a sufficient land area is cleared of threats, and when the land owner makes an effort to
improve the area, settlers may be attracted. Settlers bring a host of skills and professions of which the land
owner may take advantage. Some may seek to reside within the castle walls, whilst others might establish a
small thorp or village just beyond. Settlers become the backbone of the local economy, for they are the farmers,
fishermen, hunters, millers, shoemakers, and so forth. Note that these are free persons who buy or rent and pay
taxes to the lord (typically 5 sp per person per month).

Hirelings: The personnel of the castle or stronghold comprise a variety of professions, from common workers
to specialists. Whilst not exhaustive, the secondary skills list (see VOL. I, BACKGROUND, secondary skills)
provides a sampling of possibilities. They are compiled here for easy reference:

Animal trainer, armourer, atilliator, baker / cook, barber / dentist, bar- / innkeeper, black- / metalsmith,
boat- / shipwright, bookbinder, bowyer / fletcher, brewer / vintner, butcher / salter, carpenter,
cart- / wainwright, chandler, charcoaler / peatman, clothier / dyer, cobbler / shoemaker, cooper, engineer,
farmer, fisherman / whaler, fuller, furrier / skinner, gardener, gemcutter / jeweller, grocer,
gaffer / glassblower / glazier, guard / watchman, jailer / turnkey, herdsman / pack handler, hunter / trapper,
labourer / yardman, leatherworker / saddler / tanner, limner / painter / sculptor, linkboy / messenger,
locksmith, logger / woodcutter, longshoreman / stevedore, mason / slater, merchant / monger, miller, miner,
minstrel / musician, mortician, navigator, potter, riverman / waterman, roofer / thatcher, roper, sailor / seaman,
scribe / scrivener, stabler, sword- / weaponsmith, tailor / weaver, teamster, tinker, wheelwright, wire drawer.

Some of the above occupations are noted in the ADVENTURE, hirelings portion of this work, including wages,
which may be extrapolated from by the referee to derive salaries for the other retainers noted above.

Mercenaries and Soldiers: The four principal character classes (fighter, magician, cleric, thief) and several
of their respective subclasses will automatically attract mercenaries to serve them upon gaining 9th level and
establishing proper fortifications. Other soldiers and mercenaries must be sought and hired (see ADVENTURE,
hirelings). Players and referee should together determine how many will reside within and how many will reside
without the walls of the castle. Of course, in the hoary wilderness of Hyperborea, instances will arise in which
outside villages are not possible; all must live within or just outside the walls of the fortress.

Peasant Workers: Peasant workers are neither slaves nor free men. They are bound to the lord and typically
do not earn money; they work (up to 12 hours per day) to provide shelter for their families, though the most
productive examples sometimes earn enough extra money to buy their freedom. In many cases the sons of
peasants become peasants themselves, unless they are fortunate enough to apprentice under master craftsmen.
Most peasants plant, fertilize, and harvest crops, whilst others herd animals. Just lords will continue to provide
food and shelter to their peasant workers during the lightless year of Bat, as well as the nigh lightless years of
Fox and Bear (see VOL. VI, CALENDAR, years of the cycle). It is during these leanest and most desperate
years that men are oft forced to indenture themselves to a lord.

Slaves: Slavery is not uncommon in Hyperborea, from farm workers, to ship rowers, to domestic servants. The
practice varies from culture to culture. For instance, in the City-State of Khromarium, slavery is not illegal, but it
is frowned upon; in Scythium, slavery is a common practice; and in New Amazonia, it is forbidden.

                and bards (a thief subclass) may take up any weapon and wield it with adequate confidence and
                proficiency. This adaptability stems from training in a variety of weapon combat styles.

  ter games are wide open for a coterie to take up roles in, from acting as diplomats and agents to curry favor, to bartering
  secrets to the highest bidder, to playing every side against the middle and risking everything to come out on top.

  why is this person lying? Where is Matelda Giovani and whose side is she really on? How much of all this do the
  Nosferatu know? Who knows Philip’s true fate and how can the coterie find out? The Storyteller can adjust the
  details throughout to fit the story, all the way up to deciding how soon the conflict between Alfonzo and Gabriella

The classes from Dungeon Crawl Classic: cleric, thief, warrior, and wizard are viable in Hubris and can be chosen
by a player who did not roll a demi-human occupation, or they can choose a new class from Hubris: Alchemist,

a Judge is more than welcome to include them. The five demi-human classes are: Avarian, Ekrask, Half Demon,

                   Description: Circuit Riders are clergymen who travel by horseback through remote regions to offer services to hamlets
                   and smaller villages who lack a church. These services include clerical tasks like reading legal documents and letters
                   to illiterate villagers. They also include traditional religious tasks like baptisms, funerals, and weddings. From time to
                   time, a Circuit Rider is asked to investigate supernatural occurrences or perform more dangerous ceremonies like
                   exorcisms.

HENRI DE TOULOUSE-LAUTREC (The Demon of Paris)
Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, more usually
referred to as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, was among the most
important artists of the Post-Impressionist movement and was                          HENRI DE TOULOUSE-LAUTREC
particularly active in Paris during the 1880s and 1890s. He was
born to aristocratic parents in 1864 in the Tarn department of
southern France, his family being descendants of the Counts of
Toulouse and Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa. Henri’s parents
separated when he was just four years old and he was raised first
by a nanny and later by his mother in Paris.

Toulouse-Lautrec suffered from a genetic disorder, sometimes
attributed to his family’s history of inbreeding (his mother and
father were first cousins; his grandmothers were sisters). During
his youth, his legs ceased to grow and, although he developed
an adult’s torso, he had child-sized legs and was only 154 cm (5’
1”) tall. As a result of his physical limitations, Toulouse-Lautrec           AWARENESS           4        PRESENCE            5
concentrated on his artistic abilities which had been recognised              COORDINATION        2        RESOLVE             2
from a young age, and he went on to study at the studio of                    INGENUITY           3        STRENGTH            2

meets him in Amsterdam in 1658, Rembrandt is revealed to be
a difficult and prickly character, unwelcoming to visitors and
generally rather grumpy.

At this point in his life, Rembrandt lives alone, his wife Saskia
having died of tuberculosis in 1642 and his son Titus away
studying in Leiden. Rembrandt himself is on the verge of
bankruptcy. He blames his ill fortunes on those speculators and
investors who commissioned him to paint portraits of their wives
and mistresses, but who when the time came could not pay him
for his work as they had lost all their money on the stock market.
He points at tulip mania as being the cause of their losses, though           AWARENESS         5           PRESENCE       4

just has a long memory for wrongs done against him. In truth, the             INGENUITY         3           STRENGTH       3
painter has always lived beyond his means, buying art, prints and
rarities for an ever growing collection which he is now having to
auction off to pay his debts.                                                SKILLS

When told by Nyssa that his work would in the future be highly
valued and remembered, Rembrandt’s response is that it is little             TRAITS
comfort for him to know that he will be highly regarded after his            Argumentative
death. He would prefer his rewards now, not while he was lying in            Impoverished

She became Rembrandt’s lover, but successfully sued the artist for           TECH LEVEL: 3
breach of promise to marry her. Rembrandt believes himself to be
beyond redemption.
                                                                             STORY POINTS: 12
In order to make ends meet, Rembrandt is willing to paint almost
anything: portraits, landscapes, biblical scenes. But he draws
the line at “fancy women and dogs”. His latest commission is
from Countess Mach-Teldak (see V15), though he has never met
her in person. He has been hired to draw “vessels of the stars”,
and so the greatest painter of his age is effectively working as a
draughtsman.

Even after the passage of sixteen years, Rembrandt still feels the
loss of his wife deeply. At night, he sits alone in the darkness
because it is then that he feels close to Saskia. It’s as if she’s still
there beside him in the shadows and shapes that form in the
flicker of the candlelight. To Rembrandt, it often feels as if she’s
always in the next room, just out of sight. Saskia was his life, and
without her he has little reason to go on. But he does, though it
never gets any easier.

At the end of his life, Rembrandt outlived both his son and his
common-law-wife, Hendrickje Stoffels, and died alone as a pauper
in 1669. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Westerkerk in
Amsterdam, but his remains were removed and destroyed twenty
years later, as was the practice for dealing with the graves of the
poor at that time.

RICHARD III (The Kingmaker)
Shakespeare’s (see V118) depiction of Richard III as a villainous
murderer with a hunchback and withered arm is generally
considered by modern scholars to be Tudor propaganda written in                                 RICHARD III
order to please Elizabeth I and draws heavily from Thomas More’s
History of King Richard III, which portrays Richard as an archetypal
tyrant with physical defects reflecting his villainous character.

When the Doctor travelled back to 1483 to investigate the fates
of the Princes in the Tower (possible victims of Richard), he
discovered that Richard did not covet the throne of England,
initially at least, but he does indeed have both a hunchback and

had been attacked by a water-based species known as the Nix,
who made it rain on her homeworld for a whole year. The towns
and cities were inundated and the Countess had no choice but to
flee. The Nix pursued her flame-ship across the stars and she was

     ing new potions. A character can create larger batches of potion
     by further increasing the test’s Difficulty Number. For each extra      Arcane Mutterings

                                        into a full sword, the wielder must dip the hilt into freshly
                                        spilled blood. The Hilt will suck up the blood and form a

Creating the Third Negative Aspect
Give each of your players an index card on which to write down a possi-
ble negative aspect. The negative aspects affect how Anthony acts in his
daily life. They will be something that limit his perception, predispose
him toward destructive behaviors and disengagement, or arrange his pri-
orities in a toxic way. Ask each player to write down an idea for the third
aspect on their card.
    Collect the index cards from your players and read each out loud. Let
the players decide which aspect they prefer. If they can’t reach a consen-
sus, work with them to re-word one of the aspects to something they do
agree on or pick one for them to keep things moving.

                               S.P.I.R.I.T.S.


FACES
Each negative aspect has three faces. The first is the figment or mental
avatar of the emotion behind the aspect. The second and third faces are
memories of real people outside the client’s mind: someone who helped
to create the emotion or who has recently reinforced it. The faces for each
aspect are unique and do not overlap.
Aspect: Someday I Will Die Alone
Figment: Naomi Pine, owner of a popular club and all the dancers
within it.
Originated by: Angela Small, his mother who abandoned him as a child.
Reinforced by: Quinn, his administrative assistant who writes mean
blog posts about him.
Aspect: Art Is a Waste
Figment: Felix Morello, the city’s criminal kingpin.
Originated by: Gerald Maddox, his uncle—a painter who died poor.
Reinforced by: Alice, his niece who wants money to attend art school.
    Ask your players to think of three faces for the third negative aspect:
one figment, one originator, and one reinforcer. Figments need a name
and a brief explanation of how or why they have power and influence in
the mental landscape. The people who originated and reinforced the neg-
ative aspect need a name, a relationship to the client, and a brief explana-
tion of how they’re related to the negative aspect.
    Write the names and information of the six people who are memories,
not figments, on separate index cards.

            PET THEORIES
            Most SPIRITs have at least one pet theory about their work. Ask your
            players to consider what their character thinks about the job and what
            they think their “real life” might be. SPIRITs may be dead, comatose,
            anthropomorphized ideas, memories, dreaming, spiritual time travelers,
            or something else—what is their character’s pet theory? What is the char-
            acter’s idea about what comes next, if they think a “next” even exists?


                                             Pregenerated S.P.I.R.I.T.S.
If your players wish to play pregenerated SPIRITs, you can use the three sample characters
provided on page 293 of this adventure. Stats are provided for Fate Accelerated ver-
sions of each character, including their individual aspects, approaches, and stunts.




            Opening Scene: Trouble at Rita’s
            The scene opens in a small alleyway across the street from an inviting
            Italian restaurant. Warm light spills over the sidewalk out of large picture
            windows and the restaurant bustles with activity. Over the door, a sign
            reads Rita’s. The noise stops suddenly like a held breath and you watch a
            man be dragged out the front door and tossed onto the sidewalk. Behind
            them, a man in a well-tailored suit follows, his hands casually in his pock-
            ets. “I’m disappointed in you, Gerald,” he says.

Gerald Maddox, the mental dossier supplies, Anthony’s painter uncle who
died penniless. He helped form Anthony’s aspect, Art Is a Waste and is asso-
ciated with the figment, Felix Morello, and Alice, Anthony’s niece..
    “I want that sketchbook. Bring it to me in three days, or I’ll forget that
we’ve always been great friends,” the suited man—Morello, probably—
says. He nods to his men and they follow him back into Rita’s, leaving
Gerald on the sidewalk.
     Down toward one end of the street, raucous music jangles out of a
large nightclub. Down toward the other end, your players can find the
third lair they designed.
     Will the SPIRITs talk with Gerald and learn more about this sketch-
book? Or will they head into Rita’s and find out what Felix Morello
is planning?

DOING THE JOB
This opening scene starts the “laying groundwork” phase of the SPIR-
ITs’ task. Convincing the client to change is a massive challenge. Laying
groundwork makes the challenge manageable by changing Anthony’s
perception, digging up his lost humanity, and nullifying the figments’
toxic influence.
    When the SPIRITs finally confront Anthony, the GM has 30 challenge
points to distribute among the three arguments they make to him about
why he should change his ways. If the SPIRITs don’t lay any groundwork,
each argument will be a +10 difficulty—nearly impossible to overcome.
Since the SPIRITs need to successfully make two of their three argu-
ments, laying groundwork to reduce these difficulties and build up posi-
tive assets is critical.
    SPIRITs lay groundwork three ways:

     • Changing the negative aspects
     • Creating new, positive aspects
     • Taking down the three figments

Reading the Book
Throughout the book icons have been used to denote different types of
sidebars according to the following schema:
        Examples: Examples of rules in use
X
        Options: Alternative ways to use the game.
O
        Designer Notes: Clarification on the reasoning behind certain
D       decisions, and suggestions regarding how to use them in play.

Additionally, we have made regular use of common RPG terms such as
NPC or Game Master on the assumption that the reader is already familiar
with this terminology.

The Adjectives
The most important thing to understand about Fudge is how it describes
things. Rather than assigning numerical values to elements like skills it uses
adjectives, which are ranked as follows: Abysmal, Terrible, Poor, Mediocre,
Average, Fair, Good, Great, Superb, Epic, and Legendary. Consider: a
bodyguard might be a Good swordsman but have Mediocre social skills.
He’ll probably win a fight with an artist who’s a Superb painter but a Poor
swordsman. Almost anything can be described using this ladder — an
empire may field a Superb army or a spaceship may be limping by with a
Poor engine.

Rolling the Dice
To roll dice for Fate, pick your starting level (say, Good) and roll four six-
sided dice. For each 1 or 2, move down one step, and for each 5 or 6 move
up one. Lets say we rolled 2,3,5 and 5. Go down a step because of the 2,
from Good to Fair, but then go up a step thanks to the first 5 (from Fair to

      Combine this with the result from Table 12a to get a summary of the character. For example, a roll of 4+6 on Table 12a and
      a roll of 4+1 on Table 12b gives the extra an aspect of Morose Soldier.

      Appearance
      As with Table 12a, you can roll on this table more than once, but not more than once on any given column. If a roll seems
      inappropriate, feel free to swap column and row, use the roll for a different table, or just roll again. The idea is to inspire, not constrain.

          For example: Mike wants to know more about this foreign guildmaster: apart from being a superb negotiator,
          he’s a total mystery. His first roll on Table 12a is Dim-Witted—but that can’t be right. So he applies that roll to
          Table 12c instead, for an aspect of Immaculate. Perfect. Another roll on Table 12a yields Well-Spoken, and Mike
          already knows the guy’s a merchant, so there’s no need to roll on Table 12b. However, Well-Spoken Merchant and
          Immaculate doesn’t really provide a fresh angle on the character, so Mike keeps rolling.
             A few rolls later, the guildmaster is also Diminutive, Corpulent, Energetic, and Mostly Truthful. Mike now has an
          image of a portly little guy who talks fast and persuasively, rarely sits down, dresses to the nines, and finds ways
          to get what he wants without compromising his ethics too much.

     to destroy the collection, but one wants to do it very sneakily, while the other is
     assembling a flashy bomb.




32   FATE: WORLDS OF ADVENTURE
Hooking the Players
During the course of a game, the PCs should learn about either a full scheme or
the planning around one of the breakpoints. This does not, however, ensure their
involvement. For that, you need to either use the PCs’ faction ties and debts owed
to pull them in or set the scheme or breakpoint against a PC goal. For example,
the PCs might need one of the books the factions are planning to steal or destroy.
Alternatively, a job could require that the PCs consult the very same librarian
that the factions are impersonating. Stopping the impersonation then leads to
stopping the theft or bomb.
   Another way to hook players into a faction plot is to align PC goals with a fac-
tion scheme. Such strange bedfellows can give opportunities for some interesting
roleplay and chances for the PCs to incur or earn debts with the faction.

Lucid Colors
Assembling the Plot
Quest plots are fairly straightforward. A specific color or effect is needed, so the
PCs must travel through dreams to locate and retrieve the color. The difficulty
arises either from the rarity of the color or from the dangers of the dream around
it, such as attacking monsters or an unstable landscape. In the course of a job or
working for or against a faction, the PCs can need a certain color they do not
already have. This then triggers the quest. The need also exerts a sense of urgency
and even a timeline.
   Immediate response plots vary a lot. A color causes problems or the layers of
reality thin. Here are some possibilities:
    • A lucid color was mixed into someone’s home paint. Now anyone who
      sleeps in the spare bedroom falls into a coma.
    • An up-and-coming painter used lucid colors in their latest work. Those who
      spend too much time in proximity to the painting lose their inhibitions.
    • Children have been telling stories of seeing small fairies or hearing singing
      at the edges of a park calling the children into the woods. One child has
      gone missing.
    • A monster, visible only through goggles with the right lenses, is lost and
      attacking a bridge. News crews report a strange, localized earthquake.
      Many civilians are in danger.
  Basically, just read over the colors in play and ask yourself, “What’s the worst
that could happen?” The answer would likely make for an interesting plot.
  These problems can tie to other plots, but they can also occur on their own.
PCs will then have to decide between continuing to pursue their original goal
or following a detour to fix a more immediate problem but allow their rivals to
get ahead of them.




                                                                          PRISM        33
     Hooking the Players
     Present the problem and, if necessary, endanger an NPC or location the PCs care
     about. Otherwise, you can compel their aspects so that they cannot ignore what
     is happening. Plots about lucid colors make great hooks for faction and job plots.
     Just encourage your players to ask why the problem happened, who is behind it,
     or what the real goal was.
        Also, whenever the PCs solve a problem, always look for the twist. For example,
     the PCs find the lost boy and then strengthen reality, sealing the fairies away back
     in their own world. The twist is that they actually brought back a changeling. This
     creates a hook for a job plot—contain the changeling and rescue the child. Or,
     the PCs destroy the painting that was affecting everyone around it. Consequently,
     they’re now the subjects of a police investigation. The twist is that one of the detec-
     tives is Lucid and a member of a rival faction. This creates a hook for a faction
     plot. Not every solution needs a twist, but it’s a good way to tie plots together or

     friend, a former imaginary friend living within dreams, a faction calling in a debt,
     or anyone. The question then is: what would that person want?
        The client can even be the PCs themselves. Their equipment does not last forever
     and can be lost or damaged, and on occasion they will need to make new gear or
     repair what they already have.

     Hooking the Players
     The hook for a job is obvious—someone asks for the PCs’ help. If players refuse
     the hook, use some of the techniques discussed for color and faction plots to raise
     the stakes and reincorporate the plot.
       First, ask yourself, what’s the worst that could happen? This is your consequence
     of inaction. Then think through one or two ways the PCs could notice events
     moving toward the consequence and stop it from happening. These are your
     breakpoints. Use them in the background and for story fodder, just as you do
     with faction breakpoints.
       And if the worst should happen? Well, it should make for an interesting session.
     Put the PCs in danger and play out each rippling consequence.

THE CURIOUS CASE OF KLARA BOSKO
This adventure will introduce you to each of the elements of the Prism world, from
collecting lucid colors in dreams to tangling with factions to dealing with another
layer of reality. The adventure is divided into three acts, and each act into two parts.
If you don’t want to be spoiled, I recommend leaving this chapter to the GM.




                                                                             PRISM         35
     Act One: The Artist of Dreams

     An Email from Klara Bosko
     The email arrived late in the afternoon from a Klara Bosko. A quick online search
     revealed that Klara is a painter in the city whose fantastical paintings have been gain-
     ing a lot of attention. After her latest show was recently and inexplicably postponed,
     rumors have been spreading that she is working on something incredible.
       The email read:
           Hello,

           I heard that you have some useful skills.

           Meet me where dreams collide tonight. I have a
           proposition for you.

                                                                      -Klara Bosko

       Most people prefer to meet in a nice café, but artists are weird.
       Night has fallen and you are now asleep and dreaming. All of you are in your own
     dreams. You will need to get to the Nexus for the meeting. When you first visited the
     Nexus, you had to pass through one of your worst nightmares. What did you fight?
       Ask players to describe the nightmare their characters defeated and why it
     scared them. This is an opportunity for players to build up some backstory for
     their characters. Ask a couple follow-up questions about the characters to help
     you get a better handle on them. For characters who have never been to the
     Nexus, which is unlikely to be any of the PCs, run the battle with the nightmare
     to get Nexus access.
     The Nexus is where all dreams and lucid dreamers meet. Its appearance fluctuates.
     What does it look like tonight?
        Encourage your players to describe the Nexus. If they get stuck, some ideas
     for the space include a very large train station or an island at the center of a large
     river delta with rivers flowing out in every direction.
     When you arrive, Klara Bosko is waiting for you. She is a short woman with a dark
     blue undercut, freckles all over—some of which she’s connected into constellations—and
     a nervous smile. Brown and violet paint is stuck in her cuticles.
        Klara talks with the PCs. She confirms that she is an artist and explains that she
     is hunting for a color that she calls Smauk. The color creates fear and awe—its

standardized type of book.
      Once the Linking Book is
written, it will always lead to the same place. Large scale movement of
the frame of reference (like rotation of a planet and movement around a
star) seems to be automatically taken into account. Other changes to the
environment are not, however. For example, if the Book was written on the
roof of a building and the building was demolished, travelers will link in
mid-air and fall.
      Because of the need to describe the area around a linking point, it’s
difficult to write a usable Linking Book in something that is moving, like a boat
or a train. Secure D’ni installations often took advantage of this by making
rotating buildings.

      Linking
           Linking is easy. All someone has to do is open a Book (Linking or
      Descriptive), place their hand on the Linking panel, and they are teleported
      to the location the book points to (known as the Linking point). Travel is

     to destroy the collection, but one wants to do it very sneakily, while the other is
     assembling a flashy bomb.




32   FATE: WORLDS OF ADVENTURE
Hooking the Players
During the course of a game, the PCs should learn about either a full scheme or
the planning around one of the breakpoints. This does not, however, ensure their
involvement. For that, you need to either use the PCs’ faction ties and debts owed
to pull them in or set the scheme or breakpoint against a PC goal. For example,
the PCs might need one of the books the factions are planning to steal or destroy.
Alternatively, a job could require that the PCs consult the very same librarian
that the factions are impersonating. Stopping the impersonation then leads to
stopping the theft or bomb.
   Another way to hook players into a faction plot is to align PC goals with a fac-
tion scheme. Such strange bedfellows can give opportunities for some interesting
roleplay and chances for the PCs to incur or earn debts with the faction.

Lucid Colors
Assembling the Plot
Quest plots are fairly straightforward. A specific color or effect is needed, so the
PCs must travel through dreams to locate and retrieve the color. The difficulty
arises either from the rarity of the color or from the dangers of the dream around
it, such as attacking monsters or an unstable landscape. In the course of a job or
working for or against a faction, the PCs can need a certain color they do not
already have. This then triggers the quest. The need also exerts a sense of urgency
and even a timeline.
   Immediate response plots vary a lot. A color causes problems or the layers of
reality thin. Here are some possibilities:
    • A lucid color was mixed into someone’s home paint. Now anyone who
      sleeps in the spare bedroom falls into a coma.
    • An up-and-coming painter used lucid colors in their latest work. Those who
      spend too much time in proximity to the painting lose their inhibitions.
    • Children have been telling stories of seeing small fairies or hearing singing
      at the edges of a park calling the children into the woods. One child has
      gone missing.
    • A monster, visible only through goggles with the right lenses, is lost and
      attacking a bridge. News crews report a strange, localized earthquake.
      Many civilians are in danger.
  Basically, just read over the colors in play and ask yourself, “What’s the worst
that could happen?” The answer would likely make for an interesting plot.
  These problems can tie to other plots, but they can also occur on their own.
PCs will then have to decide between continuing to pursue their original goal
or following a detour to fix a more immediate problem but allow their rivals to
get ahead of them.




                                                                          PRISM        33
     Hooking the Players
     Present the problem and, if necessary, endanger an NPC or location the PCs care
     about. Otherwise, you can compel their aspects so that they cannot ignore what
     is happening. Plots about lucid colors make great hooks for faction and job plots.
     Just encourage your players to ask why the problem happened, who is behind it,
     or what the real goal was.
        Also, whenever the PCs solve a problem, always look for the twist. For example,
     the PCs find the lost boy and then strengthen reality, sealing the fairies away back
     in their own world. The twist is that they actually brought back a changeling. This
     creates a hook for a job plot—contain the changeling and rescue the child. Or,
     the PCs destroy the painting that was affecting everyone around it. Consequently,
     they’re now the subjects of a police investigation. The twist is that one of the detec-
     tives is Lucid and a member of a rival faction. This creates a hook for a faction
     plot. Not every solution needs a twist, but it’s a good way to tie plots together or

     friend, a former imaginary friend living within dreams, a faction calling in a debt,
     or anyone. The question then is: what would that person want?
        The client can even be the PCs themselves. Their equipment does not last forever
     and can be lost or damaged, and on occasion they will need to make new gear or
     repair what they already have.

     Hooking the Players
     The hook for a job is obvious—someone asks for the PCs’ help. If players refuse
     the hook, use some of the techniques discussed for color and faction plots to raise
     the stakes and reincorporate the plot.
       First, ask yourself, what’s the worst that could happen? This is your consequence
     of inaction. Then think through one or two ways the PCs could notice events
     moving toward the consequence and stop it from happening. These are your
     breakpoints. Use them in the background and for story fodder, just as you do
     with faction breakpoints.
       And if the worst should happen? Well, it should make for an interesting session.
     Put the PCs in danger and play out each rippling consequence.

34   FATE: WORLDS OF ADVENTURE
THE CURIOUS CASE OF KLARA BOSKO
This adventure will introduce you to each of the elements of the Prism world, from
collecting lucid colors in dreams to tangling with factions to dealing with another
layer of reality. The adventure is divided into three acts, and each act into two parts.
If you don’t want to be spoiled, I recommend leaving this chapter to the GM.




                                                                             PRISM         35
     Act One: The Artist of Dreams

     An Email from Klara Bosko
     The email arrived late in the afternoon from a Klara Bosko. A quick online search
     revealed that Klara is a painter in the city whose fantastical paintings have been gain-
     ing a lot of attention. After her latest show was recently and inexplicably postponed,
     rumors have been spreading that she is working on something incredible.
       The email read:
           Hello,

           I heard that you have some useful skills.

           Meet me where dreams collide tonight. I have a
           proposition for you.

                                                                      -Klara Bosko

       Most people prefer to meet in a nice café, but artists are weird.
       Night has fallen and you are now asleep and dreaming. All of you are in your own
     dreams. You will need to get to the Nexus for the meeting. When you first visited the
     Nexus, you had to pass through one of your worst nightmares. What did you fight?
       Ask players to describe the nightmare their characters defeated and why it
     scared them. This is an opportunity for players to build up some backstory for
     their characters. Ask a couple follow-up questions about the characters to help
     you get a better handle on them. For characters who have never been to the
     Nexus, which is unlikely to be any of the PCs, run the battle with the nightmare
     to get Nexus access.
     The Nexus is where all dreams and lucid dreamers meet. Its appearance fluctuates.
     What does it look like tonight?
        Encourage your players to describe the Nexus. If they get stuck, some ideas
     for the space include a very large train station or an island at the center of a large
     river delta with rivers flowing out in every direction.
     When you arrive, Klara Bosko is waiting for you. She is a short woman with a dark
     blue undercut, freckles all over—some of which she’s connected into constellations—and
     a nervous smile. Brown and violet paint is stuck in her cuticles.
        Klara talks with the PCs. She confirms that she is an artist and explains that she
     is hunting for a color that she calls Smauk. The color creates fear and awe—its

             Step 1: Choose a Giri & Record Glory
                 Giri means Duty. In A World of Dew, a character’s Giri is their
             calling, their job, and how they live their life, a combination of all of
             the pressures of modern life. It is also a mechanic that defines many of
             your character’s unique abilities and traits.
                 To determine your Giri, think about your character’s role within
             the City. Are you a Painter of beautiful scenery, maybe a scheming
             Gaijin Dutch Merchant? Or even a Samurai who is the last living
             member of an entire Clan, forced to work a job like so many others?
                 You may choose the same Giri as other players, but differentiate
             your abilities, advantages, and aspects so you all have unique stories
             to tell. It’s no fun to all play the same character, facing the same
                               problems every session.

disinterred by future English Jacobins.
     Despite debts incurred by collapsing East India stock,
Burke remained generous, convivial, and sanguine to his
death. His conversation was witty, his debate passionate, his
imagination brooding, and his powers of foresight
immense. His enemies suspected him falsely of being a
secret Catholic or even a Jesuit.

     Napoleon’s lifetime was also the age of Mozart, Haydn,
and Beethoven. Instrumental music had reached new heights
of popularity. Orchestras featured violins, violas, flutes,
oboes, and French horns, among others. Chamber ensembles
included string trios and quartets and piano trios, all of which
attracted specially written sonata music. The bourgeoisie
joined the aristocracy in attending grand professional per-
formances in purpose-built concert halls. Noble and bour-
geois parents hired tutors to train their children in music.
     In 1769, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was still a child
prodigy touring Italy and composing sonatas, operas, and other
music on a commission basis for the nobility. In Salzburg dur-
ing the 1770s and in Vienna during the 1780s, his output for
the German princes and upper Austrian society was prolific
and varied.

     Joseph Haydn, with the patronage of the Esterházy

form of symphonies, string quartets, and sonatas. From the
1760s onward, his reputation spread throughout Europe. Ora-
torios such as The Seasons (1801) ensured his status as
Europe’s preeminent composer at the turn of the century.
     Ludwig van Beethoven’s music married classical forms
with romantic and revolutionary themes. Between 1800 and
1814, he completed eight major symphonies, plus Wellington’s
         Victory in 1813 to celebrate the battle of Vitoria. His
         music was recognized throughout Europe during the
          1810s, and he provided musical entertainment to the

obtained, it may also be possible to compare it to
a database of known prints and identify it by type
(for example, as a Brand X tire rather than a Brand
Y tire). Footprints may also tell a trained investiga-
tor whether the subject was walking or running,
how tall he is, and similar facts.

      Forensic scientists try to identify soil as

a soil sample is, the easier it is to identify it as
coming from a particular place. Criminalists
examine soil characteristics such as color, min-
eral content, the size of the soil grains, soil den-
sity, and soil components (foreign matter). They
can also examine objects manufactured from

in question with the object that might have made
it (for example, they can compare a footprint to the
suspect’s shoes). If a good enough print is obtained,
it may also be possible to compare it to a data-
base of known prints and identify it by type (for
example, as a Brand X tire rather than a Brand Y
tire). Footprints may also tell a trained investigator
whether the subject was walking or running, how
tall he is, and similar facts.

Identiﬁcation is also a Complementary Skill.
SOIL (FORENSIC GEOLOGY)
      Forensic scientists try to identify soil as
coming from a particular location, thereby link-
ing soil samples found at a crime scene to soil
found in another location. The more unique
a soil sample is, the easier it is to identify it as
coming from a particular place. Criminalists
examine soil characteristics such as color, min-
eral content, the size of the soil grains, soil den-
sity, and soil components (foreign matter). They
can also examine objects manufactured from
minerals or soil, such as bricks, plaster, concrete,
and some types of insulation. The most common

an interesting challenge to heroes.
   Atavisms are also another class of spirit for sorcer-
ers to use. In the “developed” world, usually only evil
magicians employ atavisms; the traditions of Europe,
the Middle East, and the Orient do not approve of these
id created spirits. They did not even have a name until
the English painter and occultist Austin Osman Spare
thought of calling them “atavisms” to represent the
earthy, primitive energies they embody. Before that,
they were (rather confusingly) called “elementals”—
when they were referred to at all.
   In “primitive” cultures, however, priests and shamans
routinely evoke atavisms. An atavism might actually
be Summoned for a specific purpose, or it might just
be the “special effect” of a spell. Most obviously, ata-
visms can be used to deliver a “psychic attack” to one’s
enemies. Atavisms can also be used, however, to aug-
ment a person’s strength, endurance or other physical
abilities. As totemic familiars, they can help shamans
in all sorts of work on the Astral Plane.

ETHEREAL ARTIFACTS
Paints of Michelangelo
  When Michelangelo Buonarotti
painted the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel between 1508 and 1512 A.D.,
the raw power and emotion of both his
act and the place enchanted his palette
of paints. They have been blessed ever
since, and hold great power.
  When found, the Paints of
Michelangelo appear to be an ancient
painting palette with dried globs of
paint still attached. If wetted, these
ancient paints are still usable and allow
the painter to create amazing scenes.
The Paints of Michelangelo enhance
the Artistry (Painting) skill with a level
of 6. In order to be effective, the user
must utter a 5 minute prayer asking for
God’s guidance. The Paints of
Michelangelo may be used by human
beings or angels, but not demons.

A.D. Under his rule, Bohemia enjoyed
prosperity as Austria was added to the

flocked to the country. All was well
until the Mongols attacked Moravia
during the 1240s.
   Fortunately, the armies of Bohemia
repelled the Mongol horde. His legend

      mortals into the frost-bitten north.

Dark Medieval Times Kickstart Table (d4)
   1. Signs point to a witch in the midst of the fief. The characters are tasked with rooted him or her
      out and putting them to swift justice. But is the supernatural afoot, or is someone being framed
      for a slight real or imagined?
   2. The fief has paid its yearly tribute to the lord of the land, but the collectors have gone missing.
      They were last seem at the outskirts of the fief; the characters have been tasked with discovering
      the errant tribute, else the fief face a crippling repayment to the lord.
   3. The peasant farmers have been struck with a strange malady that causes them to sing, whirl, and
      dance until they die. The characters have been tasked with discovering either the cause of this
      disease or its cure.
   4. A dishonored knight has sought shelter within the border of the fiefdom. Why has he come to
      this particular land? Who pursues him? What has he carried back with him from the Holy Land?
Southern Gothic Kickstart Table (d4)
   1. The patriarch of a powerful, wealthy family has died. The characters have been tasked with
       taking his remains to a familial crypt on the outskirts of town. They must be on their guard as a
       faction of town elders would like to make sure the corpse never reaches its final resting place—
       why?
   2. The characters have been asked to escort the daughters of a old-blood family to a masked ball. To
       decline the pleasure would be seen as an affront to the family's honor. However, one of the
       daughters is not what she seems.
   3. The town's pastor has asked the characters to infiltrate and investigate the doings of the traveling
       preacher who has set up a tent revival in the town square. What does the pastor really want of
       them and what is the preacher's real reason for setting himself up in the heart of the town?
   4. A worker from a local plantation has contacted the characters and wishes to meet with them. The
       note he sent claims that he has something of terrifying importance to tell them, but before the
       characters can meet with him he turns up dead—drowned in the fountain in front of the mayor's
       home. What mystery is being concealed here? Can the characters uncover it before a secret from
       the town's past erupts to trouble the present?

Behind the Facade of the Seaside Town Kickstart Table (d4)
   1. The characters have been tasked by a wealthy art collector with locating a painter from the
       seaside town who has recently gone missing. While investigating his disappearance, they will
       discover that his paintings have also gone missing; what horrible truths were disclosed by those
       canvasses?
   2. The characters have been tasked by a merchant-prince with uncovering why all of the ships that
       have recently docked at the seaside town were never heard from again. Is this the work of a
       wrecking crew or is something supernatural afoot?
   3. The characters have been tasked by a scholar with taking notes on a rare tome owned by the
       seaside town's library. While copying out the required section of the book, one character
       discovers something unnerving about their family history that points to the possible location of a
       lost inheritance that could be sought out and reclaimed.
   4. The characters have been tasked by a smuggler to bring in barrels of rum through the “secret”
       tunnels that link the beach-caves to the ancient cemetery. Of course, the tunnels are already in
       use...but by whom and for what purpose?

Pilgrims in a Strange Land Kickstart Table (d4)
    1. Winter is coming and the colony's food stores are perilously low. It is rumored that the lost
       colony had plentiful reserves of food housed in underground vaults. The players have been

       sustenance?

       plea for help, but they are curiously silent about the nature of their attackers.
    3. Goodwife Martinette had made a habit of going into the woods alone, now she stands accused of
       witchcraft and adultery. Is she really a servant of the Devil or is she a scapegoat drawing
       attention away from the real evil afflicting the colony? The characters have been tasked with
       determining her guilt.
    4. Ominous drums coming from the forest break the silence of the night. Something is amassing in
       the woods, and by the sounds of the drums it is moving ever closer to the colony. The characters
       have been tasked with scouting out this threat to the colony's survival.

Origami is popular among both peasant and samurai alike for

    Painter (goods) Rokugani painting is stylized and fluid,
favoring nature motifs and depictions of historic figures. As a
gift, painting is favored for its flexibility - if an Ambassador
knows the recipient’s tastes then he can commission a painter
to depict a topic they will find favorable. A Fine painter
implies not only that the Ambassador has access to an actual
painter, but also access to previously produced works of art
possessed by his clan. It is traditional for a samurai to add his
own chop to a painting upon obtaining ownership of it, and
many paintings are as famous for their previous owners as for
the quality of the work. Cost: Poor (2 points), Average (4

    Philosopher (service) It is the duty of all samurai to
seek enlightenment, each in their own fashion. This gifi
grants the Ambassador access to a temple or monastery,
allowing him to call upon the Brotherhoods wisdom.
While the teachings of a learned monk can be an
impressive gift, this is also a gift Ambassadors frequently
bestow upon themselves. A Me in the courts can be quite dif-
ficult, and few can survive long on such a penlous battlefield
without seeking guidance. Poor quality monks are often ill-
trained or intolerant. Fine monks possess true wisdom, and if
heeded may bring those who consider their teachings some
measure of enlightenment, or at least peace of mind. This gift
costs one less point for a Dragon Ambassador. Cost: Poor
(1point), Average (3 points), Fine (5 points)
    Poet (goods / service) The art of the haiku is extremely
popular throughout the Empire. Even the Crab, who normally
 spurn the more cultured arts, frequently make games of
composing spontaneous haiku (though Crab haiku tends to
be a bit more bawdy than most). Much like painting, poetry is
 quite versatile in that it can be customized to the recipient’s
 tastes. As goods, poetry suggests a written composition (and is    s m i t h (goods)

                       Origami (goods / service) Another Rokugani fine art,
                    Origami is popular among both peasant and samurai alike for
                    its cunning simplicity. Origami counts as both goods and a
                    service, as the art of creating origami can be quite entertaining
                    to watch. Origami is usually quite fragile, and should be
                    transported with care. Cost: Poor (1 point), Average (2 points),
                    Fine (4 points)
                        Painter (goods) Rokugani painting is stylized and fluid,
                    favoring nature motifs and depictions of historic figures. As a
                    gift, painting is favored for its flexibility - if an Ambassador
                    knows the recipient’s tastes then he can commission a painter
                    to depict a topic they will find favorable. A Fine painter
                    implies not only that the Ambassador has access to an actual
                    painter, but also access to previously produced works of art
                    possessed by his clan. It is traditional for a samurai to add his
                    own chop to a painting upon obtaining ownership of it, and
                    many paintings are as famous for their previous owners as for
                    the quality of the work. Cost: Poor (2 points), Average (4
                    points), Fine (7 points)
                        Philosopher (service) It is the duty of all samurai to
                    seek enlightenment, each in their own fashion. This gifi
                    grants the Ambassador access to a temple or monastery,
                    allowing him to call upon the Brotherhoods wisdom.
                    While the teachings of a learned monk can be an
                    impressive gift, this is also a gift Ambassadors frequently
                    bestow upon themselves. A Me in the courts can be quite dif-
                    ficult, and few can survive long on such a penlous battlefield
                    without seeking guidance. Poor quality monks are often ill-
                    trained or intolerant. Fine monks possess true wisdom, and if
                    heeded may bring those who consider their teachings some
                    measure of enlightenment, or at least peace of mind. This gift
                    costs one less point for a Dragon Ambassador. Cost: Poor
                    (1point), Average (3 points), Fine (5 points)
                        Poet (goods / service) The art of the haiku is extremely
                    popular throughout the Empire. Even the Crab, who normally
                     spurn the more cultured arts, frequently make games of
                    composing spontaneous haiku (though Crab haiku tends to
                    be a bit more bawdy than most). Much like painting, poetry is
                     quite versatile in that it can be customized to the recipient’s
                     tastes. As goods, poetry suggests a written composition (and is    s m i t h (goods)

Dosan. Dosan taught him a great deal about lacquerware and other
wood crafts. Before he passed away, Dosan made Mokote promise
that he would continue working in the village and would train other
young men so they would never be slaves to the land. Mokote
honored the old man's request and two years ago took on two
apprentices, Ryokai and Tadashi.
   A young craftsman, Ryokai crafts smalllacquerware boxes and in
his spare time studies and meditates with Agachi UlJ. He keeps a
room in the back of his shop. His room is modest to the point of
barrenness and his shop is clean and tidy.
   The other young craftsman, Tadashi, works with Ryokai and he
too visits Agachi UI] from time to time. He, however, does not live
as ascetically as Ryokai and has even been known to have the
occasional visitor.
   Recently, Mokote has found an interest in hiking and climbing
and makes weekly visits to Gamanzure no Oka [E]. The shop is kept
open as much as possible, but because of the three men's interests        Adventure Seed

to his life, he reveals that Ureji sold it to him. Ureji is not a stupid
man, though, and he employs informants all over the city. Perhaps
Chisuke is killed before he can reveal the truth, or a series of
messages travel to Ureji before anyone can get to him. What would
happen to Mimura (or Ekaido for that matter) if word of a
smuggler's treasure spread to the Emperor or a Crane courtier?

   US Noble Residence (Doji Norei)
    Doji Norei moved to Mimura only a few years ago. Finding most
of the homes in Omiatsu too extravagant (and expensive) she moved
into a simple home on the other side of the road. Norei met Ekaido
in the Otosan Uchi courts many summers ago, where the two
enjoyed each other's company. Ekaido was impressed with Norei's
talents as a painter and asked her to move to Mimura. There she
would find her skills unmatched and highly prized. Because of her
reputation, it is common for nobles to travel weeks to visit Norei.

Dosan. Dosan taught him a great deal about lacquerware and other
wood crafts. Before he passed away, Dosan made Mokote promise
that he would continue working in the village and would train other
young men so they would never be slaves to the land. Mokote
honored the old man's request and two years ago took on two
apprentices, Ryokai and Tadashi.
   A young craftsman, Ryokai crafts smalllacquerware boxes and in
his spare time studies and meditates with Agachi UlJ. He keeps a
room in the back of his shop. His room is modest to the point of
barrenness and his shop is clean and tidy.
   The other young craftsman, Tadashi, works with Ryokai and he
too visits Agachi UI] from time to time. He, however, does not live
as ascetically as Ryokai and has even been known to have the
occasional visitor.
   Recently, Mokote has found an interest in hiking and climbing
and makes weekly visits to Gamanzure no Oka [E]. The shop is kept

to his life, he reveals that Ureji sold it to him. Ureji is not a stupid
man, though, and he employs informants all over the city. Perhaps
Chisuke is killed before he can reveal the truth, or a series of
messages travel to Ureji before anyone can get to him. What would
happen to Mimura (or Ekaido for that matter) if word of a
smuggler's treasure spread to the Emperor or a Crane courtier?

   US Noble Residence (Doji Norei)
    Doji Norei moved to Mimura only a few years ago. Finding most
of the homes in Omiatsu too extravagant (and expensive) she moved
into a simple home on the other side of the road. Norei met Ekaido
in the Otosan Uchi courts many summers ago, where the two
enjoyed each other's company. Ekaido was impressed with Norei's
talents as a painter and asked her to move to Mimura. There she
would find her skills unmatched and highly prized. Because of her
reputation, it is common for nobles to travel weeks to visit Norei.

            Houi is set in a geographically uneven area where the
          ground is shaped in large ridges and trees grow widely.
          The village has made most of its situation, cultivating
          whatever space is left between the rocky ridges.
             Jouzousho is a large, prosperous village, boasting not
          only a geisha house but also a sake brewery. Many in
          the area see it as a recreational destination. At least one
          samurai from the Otomo family currently lives in the
          village.
             Juujiro is the smallest village of the area, and would
          not exist if not for the crossroads it surrounds. Many who
          travel between the villages stop at its inn, if only for a
          short time.
             Koujou is a modest-sized village, situated where a
          stream crosses the road, and controlling a small bridge

          and a waterwheel-powered mill. The mill produces flour
          from local rice and grain, and fresh noodles are sold at
          the local inn. A samurai of the Miya family currently
          lives here.
                                                                        51

          a pleasant place to rest. A Doji painter has been
          enjoying the serenity of the village to further
          his art.
             Sencha is a small settlement in a narrow valley between
          two rocky hills. From it, a small path leads to a nearby
          monastery, going through simple but well-maintained
          torii arch.
             Tenraku is a medium-sized village whose location on
          the road to Toshi no Naishou causes it to see a lot of
          traffic. An inn and a carpenter’s shop make it an important
          element of the local area.
             Boubi is a small and isolated village which has few
          dealings with the others listed here. It has, however,
          recently hired a small group of ronin who are staying in
          the village’s single small inn.
             Yasurugi Monastery is set upon a forested hilltop,
          reached by a shallow staircase passing under seven torii
          arches dedicated to the Seven Fortunes, the largest of
          which honors Fukurokujin. It provides spiritual guidance
          to all the villages in this region.

            Houi is set in a geographically uneven area where the
          ground is shaped in large ridges and trees grow widely.
          The village has made most of its situation, cultivating
          whatever space is left between the rocky ridges.
             Jouzousho is a large, prosperous village, boasting not
          only a geisha house but also a sake brewery. Many in
          the area see it as a recreational destination. At least one
          samurai from the Otomo family currently lives in the
          village.
             Juujiro is the smallest village of the area, and would
          not exist if not for the crossroads it surrounds. Many who
          travel between the villages stop at its inn, if only for a
          short time.
             Koujou is a modest-sized village, situated where a
          stream crosses the road, and controlling a small bridge




                                                                             chapter two
          and a waterwheel-powered mill. The mill produces flour
          from local rice and grain, and fresh noodles are sold at
          the local inn. A samurai of the Miya family currently
          lives here.
                                                                        51

          a pleasant place to rest. A Doji painter has been
          enjoying the serenity of the village to further
          his art.
             Sencha is a small settlement in a narrow valley between
          two rocky hills. From it, a small path leads to a nearby
          monastery, going through simple but well-maintained
          torii arch.
             Tenraku is a medium-sized village whose location on
          the road to Toshi no Naishou causes it to see a lot of
          traffic. An inn and a carpenter’s shop make it an important
          element of the local area.
             Boubi is a small and isolated village which has few
          dealings with the others listed here. It has, however,
          recently hired a small group of ronin who are staying in
          the village’s single small inn.
             Yasurugi Monastery is set upon a forested hilltop,
          reached by a shallow staircase passing under seven torii
          arches dedicated to the Seven Fortunes, the largest of
          which honors Fukurokujin. It provides spiritual guidance
          to all the villages in this region.

            Houi is set in a geographically uneven area where the
          ground is shaped in large ridges and trees grow widely.
          The village has made most of its situation, cultivating
          whatever space is left between the rocky ridges.
             Jouzousho is a large, prosperous village, boasting not
          only a geisha house but also a sake brewery. Many in
          the area see it as a recreational destination. At least one
          samurai from the Otomo family currently lives in the
          village.
             Juujiro is the smallest village of the area, and would
          not exist if not for the crossroads it surrounds. Many who
          travel between the villages stop at its inn, if only for a
          short time.
             Koujou is a modest-sized village, situated where a
          stream crosses the road, and controlling a small bridge




                                                                             chapter two
          and a waterwheel-powered mill. The mill produces flour
          from local rice and grain, and fresh noodles are sold at
          the local inn. A samurai of the Miya family currently
          lives here.
                                                                        51

          a pleasant place to rest. A Doji painter has been
          enjoying the serenity of the village to further
          his art.
             Sencha is a small settlement in a narrow valley between
          two rocky hills. From it, a small path leads to a nearby
          monastery, going through simple but well-maintained
          torii arch.
             Tenraku is a medium-sized village whose location on
          the road to Toshi no Naishou causes it to see a lot of
          traffic. An inn and a carpenter’s shop make it an important
          element of the local area.
             Boubi is a small and isolated village which has few
          dealings with the others listed here. It has, however,
          recently hired a small group of ronin who are staying in
          the village’s single small inn.
             Yasurugi Monastery is set upon a forested hilltop,
          reached by a shallow staircase passing under seven torii
          arches dedicated to the Seven Fortunes, the largest of
          which honors Fukurokujin. It provides spiritual guidance
          to all the villages in this region.

is Sincerity – and some GMs may wish
to include a “Flattery” emphasis for the

the ability to “be social.” There are many
ways to incorporate other Skills on a

   Origami (goods / service) Another Rokugani fine art,
Origami is popular among both peasant and samurai alike for
its cunning simplicity. Origami counts as both goods and a

    Painter (goods) Rokugani painting is stylized and fluid,
favoring nature motifs and depictions of historic figures. As a
gift, painting is favored for its flexibility - if an Ambassador
knows the recipient’s tastes then he can commission a painter
to depict a topic they will find favorable. A Fine painter
implies not only that the Ambassador has access to an actual
painter, but also access to previously produced works of art
possessed by his clan. It is traditional for a samurai to add his
own chop to a painting upon obtaining ownership of it, and
many paintings are as famous for their previous owners as for
the quality of the work. Cost: Poor (2 points), Average (4

grants the Ambassador access to a temple or monastery,
allowing him to call upon the Brotherhoods wisdom.
While the teachings of a learned monk can be an
impressive gift, this is also a gift Ambassadors frequently
bestow upon themselves. A Me in the courts can be quite dif-
ficult, and few can survive long on such a penlous battlefield
without seeking guidance. Poor quality monks are often ill-
trained or intolerant. Fine monks possess true wisdom, and if
heeded may bring those who consider their teachings some
measure of enlightenment, or at least peace of mind. This gift
costs one less point for a Dragon Ambassador. Cost: Poor
(1point), Average (3 points), Fine (5 points)
    Poet (goods / service) The art of the haiku is extremely
popular throughout the Empire. Even the Crab, who normally
 spurn the more cultured arts, frequently make games of
composing spontaneous haiku (though Crab haiku tends to
be a bit more bawdy than most). Much like painting, poetry is
 quite versatile in that it can be customized to the recipient’s
 tastes. As goods, poetry suggests a written composition (and is    s m i t h (goods)

      An interesting way to speed up character
  creation and bring some mystery to the process
  is to identify certain attributes as unknown to
  you and to the character.  For example, your PC
  might be an escapee from an experimental mental
  illness treatment that has given him powers that
  he doesn’t even know much about yet.  In that
  case, tell your GM that you want to leave one or
  more traits for her to define and keep a secret
  from you.  Or your PC’s motivation for coming
  to the island might be to follow certain clues,
  the significance of which he does not yet fully
  understand.  Your GM might well appreciate the
  freedom that this tactic gives her in manipulating
  your character into the plots that she will lay for
  him and other PCs.

Cantrip: Familiar
Each Conjurer has a single, soul-bound familiar; a common beast, an
arcane construct, or an unnatural monster. This Cantrip creates an
unbreakable bond of mutual friendship, family, and service between
two beings. They gain the ability to speak each other’s tongues, see
through each other’s eyes, and unfailingly find each other.


Spell 1 Mortal Summons
Call a mortal to travel to your location.

++   The mortal travels to you of their own free will, rather
     than by compulsion.
++   The mortal does not suffer any consequences or costs for
     their travel.
++   The caster doesn’t need the true name of the target to
     summon them.

Six of Tongues


A Famous Painter
Person

The artist, a volatile figure. A lifetime of experience distilled again and again into
paint on a canvas. A new world opens up with each viewing.


Dealer
The painter’s studio contains… (draw for a number):
●   2-6            …endless paintings of ballerinas that always sell and are always
                   replaced by more.
●   7-10           …a painting that transports the viewer to somewhere else. Stare
                   into it and move your marker to any space in the house of cards
                   but the big score itself.
●   face           …a painting that suffers any ill that befalls the painter.
●   ace            …a painting that curses all who look upon it.

But the painter… (draw for a suit):
●   Gold         …still has debts to pay. So many debts.
●   Hearts       …has found a new lover to paint, and this may well change
                 everything.
●   Leaves       …has been making regular trips out into the woods for
                 inspiration, lately.
●   Tongues      … is too busy being flattered by patrons to take much notice of
                 business or even art, really.


Protagonist
If you play a famous painter as your protagonist, your characteristics are Danger 1,
Magic 3, Persuasion 4, and Stealth 2.

If you have a famous painter as a companion, you can sacrifice them to get an extra
answer when you make a move. If you do so, discard this card.

Seven of Tongues


The House of Tongue
Location

Though it is neither the oldest nor the most prestigious pleasure house in Thieves’
Port, it is still the most legendary. Whatever you want, for a price, there is nothing
that the House of Tongue would refuse to give you.


Dealer
People talk, especially about the House of Tongue. What’s happening now? Draw a
card. What suit is it?
 If it’s gold, the house is looking to buy new mockingbirds, as its current
     population has grown small.
 If it’s hearts, the house is looking for a youth with particular talents, to satisfy
     a customer.
 If it’s leaves, the House is closed, presumptuously, in honour of the falling
     leaves or flowers.
 If it’s tongues, someone has committed a theft dressed in the mockingbird
     livery used by the House of Tongue. They are looking to hire out for
     vengeance.

During the dealer phase, draw from the deck until you reveal a gold card. Place
that card on the same space as the House of Tongue. Discard the other cards. At
the end of the scene, if this card is still on the same space, discard it.

other human enclaves to survive. He was instrumental in creat­
ing the Open Door policy of 1 02 P.A., and he favors becoming
an ally of the Coalition States, although not a full member, since
the kingdom would then lose much of its independence. An able
administrator and military commander, Mellon also prides him­
self on being a patron of the arts, although his taste is totally
lacking - he is as likely to shower a third-rate painter with
wealth as he is to reject a truly excellent work of art. His wife,
Ophelia Mellon (5th level Merchant) is as influential in the run­
ning of the kingdom as he is.
   Under the B aron-in-Chief are a number of appointed offi­
cials, including the Defense Minister, the Secretary of State, etc.
Most of these posts are filled by cronies of Mellon, some of
them former adventurers like himself. The Defense Minister, for
example, is "Hammer" Jonesy, a full-conversion ' borg ( l Oth
level) who prefers to lead the Los Alamo armies personally and
enjoys engaging in combat whenever he can; he is a very "hands
on" and "in your face" type of leader.
   There is no such thing as elections for most government offi­
cials. The citizens get to elect twelve Councilmen, who are in
charge of minor administrative tasks around the city. These in­
clude overseeing garbage collection, cleaning the streets, main­
taining public buildings, dog catching, and other mundane tasks.
Most people don' t even bother to vote, so most Councilmen are
elected by their friends and relatives, and have very little power
and influence. Most just live for the time when their achieve­
ments are noticed by the guys in real power and are given a
more important position with greater power and opportunity (a
rarity).
   Justice is very straightforward, and is administered by local
Sheriffs (70% Headhunters, 30% other men at arms), who act as
the police, judge, jury and sometimes executioner (although usu­
ally a lynch mob takes care of that part). "Trials" typically last a
couple of hours, unless no suspects have been caught. A per­
son ' s standing in the community is important, and strangers are
more likely to be convicted of crimes than even the most notori­
ous citizen. Most serious crimes carry a death sentence (includ­
ing murder, rape, and grand theft - anything over 1 00,000
credits); other crimes have a 1 - 1 0 year sentence in jail or hard la­

                         states, with the Saxons ruling Germany and the Normans under William I the Conqueror (1028-
                         1087 AD) invading and conquering Britain. The church became a secular power, reaching its
                         apogee under Pope Innocent III and promoting the Crusades, military actions in Northern
                         Africa aimed at recovering Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslims; in reality, a political
                         manuever to conquer new lands for the many dispossessed lords of Europe. In the military
                         field, there was the full development of heavy cavalry, and the first timid scientific innovations,
                         among them clockwork and the first crude lenses (Roger Bacon invented eyeglasses).
                             Late Middle Ages (1300 – 1450 AD). The Late Middle Ages open with a period of famine and
                         pestilence, which reached their height during the Black Death of 1347 – 1350. Famine, in particular,
                         was also the effect of a major climate change, with the beginning of the Little Ice Age (1300 – 1700).
                         On the political side, the Late Middle Age saw the creation of even stronger nation-states, like
                         England, France, Aragon, Castile and Portugal. This was a process full of bloodshed: in particular
                         England was ravaged by the Wars of the Roses, between Lancaster and York (1445 – 1485), and
                         the Hundred Years War (1337 – 1453) between England and France for control of the French
                         throne. Even more ground-shaking was the final collapse of Byzantium, with Constantinople being
                         conquered from Ottomans in 1453. The Church suffered a great schism, which caused the birth
                         of the Avignon Papacy. In the military field, there was the development of the longbow (English
                         longbowmen dominated the battlefields of this era) until it was made obsolete by crossbows and
                         the first gunpowder weapons. Literature underwent a renaissance, with the vernacular works of
                         Chaucer, Boccaccio, Dante, Langland and Francois Villon. The development of the compass opened
                         the way for explorers like Columbus, Vasco De Gama and Bartholomew Diaz.
                             The Eternal King. The myth of King Arthur Pendragon, ruler of medieval Britain, is one of
                         the best-loved tales of any age. King Arthur unified Britain, fought the Saxons, created chivalry
                         (particularly the famous Round Table) and died by the hand of his son Mordred, as a real tragic
                         hero should do. Legends say that he is the Eternal King and that he sleeps somewhere, in a
                         crystal grotto, ready to wake up to defend Britain in its hour of need. Well, there must be some
                         truth in this, because there are unconfirmed sightings of Arthur Pendragon during the Battle of
                         Hastings (1066) and the Battle of Britain (summer and autumn of 1940)!
                             These sightings need to be investigated quickly, before new wild legends spread.

a strange discovery in a private chapel in the small village of Vergoncey, near Mount Saint
Michelle, Normandy. Under several layers of paint he uncovered an ancient mural behind the
church’s altar. From the medieval period, it is a depiction of Saint George fighting the dragon,
a common medieval theme. What it is really strange is that the dragon fought by the Saint
is almost identical to a T-Rex and the “sword” of Saint George is a late 22nd century energy
rifle. The local Watcher suggests that Pierre Dufaut must be silenced in some manner and then
appropriate investigations carried out.

      player characters, the heroes of a TimeZero campaign.
    Before allocating any points, the player should ideally
   choose a Character Background and an Origin to create
   a unique hero. Alternatively he can select an Archetype
      (see next chapter), put the finishing touches on it and
                                                 jump into the game!



                                           Character Backgrounds




                                                                                                       CHARACTER BACKGROUNDS
All human Operatives have one thing in common: they are recruited – more or less willingly
– from history and trained to be TimeGuard agents. Despite the importance of the training at
TimeZero, they are also chosen for their background. Before starting the mechanical part of
character creation, players should take time to think about what their hero was before joining
TimeGuard. They have the whole of human history to choose from, so this can be a little
overwhelming.
    To help you focus, here is a list of character types you can use to develop an Operative’s
past. Naturally these are only suggestions, and players are encouraged to invent their own
background or tweak the following ones, maybe mixing them.
                                                                                                       57
    These are quite generic and, by combining them with different Origins (see below), you can
create very different characters from the same character type.
    Synth characters will also find this table useful (see sidebar on page 62).
    There are exactly 20 entries in the following list, so you can choose a random character type
by rolling a d20. By using it in combination with the Origin table and the Allies Personality
table of the core Savage Worlds rules, the GM can create random NPCs and TimeZero staff in
no time.
    1 – Artist. This broad category includes sculptors and writers, but also fashion designers and
similar individuals. An artist from Ancient Egypt might be a famous painter of houses, while an
artist of the 21st century might be a topnotch hair stylist. TimeGuard recruits artists because they
             tend to have a firm grasp of the culture of their own age and, when they are sent on a mission, they
             are able to notice subtle alterations that other more prosaic Operatives would not.
                 2 – Artisan. An artisan is mainly a worker, a man who makes things with his hands. He might
             be a candle maker in a medieval village, a skilled weaponsmith in Feudal Japan, or a car mechanic
             in the Roaring Twenties. They usually tend to be very practical people and, when they are alone in
             the mists of time, their manual skills can be the difference between life and death.
                 3 – Castaway. Operatives sometimes rescue people that simply cannot exist in our continuum.
             They belong to other realities that get mixed up with ours due to the actions of the Triad or

58           other time-troubling agents. They often speak totally unknown languages and tell stories of cities,
             rulers, and religions that have never existed in our world. A very few of them even belong to non-
             human races. They are totally disoriented, so the Operatives call them “Lost Sheep”.
OPERATIVES




                 As it is impossible to send castaways back to their own continuum, TimeGuard usually
             finds them a place to live in prehistory or another isolated part of time. A few of them, the most
             humanlike, are recruited and sent to fight the Triad and save the continuum.
                 4 – Commoner. The Average Joe of every era. He might be a plebeian in Ancient Rome, a
             farmer in the Middle Ages or an office worker in the 20th century. TimeGuard is interested in
             him because he is so, well… common. He can blend in with any crowd and no Triad agent will
             ever suspect that the fat man sitting in a fast-food restaurant eating nachos is in truth a skilled
             TimeGuard Operative.
                 5 – Clergyman. Priests, nuns, monks and other figures connected with religion have always
             had a great influence on human history. The character might be a priest of Apollo in ancient
             Greece, the keeper of the fire in a prehistoric tribe or a feared Spanish inquisitor in the Middle
             Ages. Clergymen are good Operatives because they are experienced in dealing with people.
                 6 – Dandy. A decadent Epicurean philosopher from Hellenic Persia, or a playboy like
             Rudolph Valentino, the dandy has a cynical view of the universe and is usually broad-minded.

                    (M) Commoners (2): See page 43.
                    Four – Guards’ Quarters: Some off-duty guards are playing cards in this room. If an
                Operative walks in, the guards question her, politely (if she is disguised as a guest) or rudely (in
                all the other cases). If the Operative’s answers don’t convince them, they summon Reisender. If
                the Triad Agent believes the heroine is a spy, he locks her up in the Hard Labor Cells (see below)
                until the end of the party, at which time he will question her “thoroughly”.
                    (M) SS Soldiers (6): See page 43.
                    Five – Arsenal: The door of this room is protected by a very sturdy lock (–4 to Lockpicking
                rolls to open it) and there is always an SS soldier on guard. A vast array of weapons and ammo
                is stored inside. Basically, the Operatives can take any weapon that the SS soldiers have, plus
                2d6 grenades (Damage: 3d6: Range: 5/10/20, MBT) and explosives. With a Repair roll they can
                also assemble a time bomb (damage: 3d10, LBT, AP 10, HW).
                    Six – Empty Room: A dusty room; a good place to rest, make Healing rolls, and hide
                corpses.
                    Seven – Torture Chamber: This room was preserved for historical purposes. It is full of
                medieval torture devices (iron maidens, racks and so on). With a Notice roll an Operative can
                find an improvised melee weapon here (Str+d6, improvised weapon) or alternatively can grab
                one of the two long swords hanged from the wall (Str+d8).
                    Eight – Larder: The food supplies of the castle are stored here. At first, the heroes do not
                notice anything interesting, but with a Notice (–4) roll they realize that the concrete of the walls
is thin, so that the sounds from nearby rooms can be heard. Draw an additional card, which
indicates the room that can be eavesdropped on. With a Smarts roll the Operatives also find a
crack through which they can take a look. The next time the Operative draws a card to explore
a location, he can choose the room he spied on.
    Nine – Hard Labor Cells: This area is in the dungeons, some distance from where the
party is going on. A dozen Jewish workers, who were used to build the bomb, are kept in the
cells. They know quite well how to reach locations from Deuce to Nine; if he can persuade them
to help, the Operative doesn’t draw a card but is automatically taken to the desired place. Being
caught talking to them automatically causes the alarm to be sounded. If a hero is captured
during this scene, he is thrown into a cell and a SS soldier is left to guard him.

    Ten – Fresco Room: Not everyone is partying tonight. The lights in this magnificent
room are on and a man is working on a big ceiling fresco. He is the Italian painter Antonio
Montaperti. He was hired by Reisender to paint a great scene of the Battle of Curzola, a minor
battle in Italian history (the forces involved were Venice against Genoa and the conflict ended




                                                                                                       CASTLE MESPELBRUNN, DECEMBER 24, 1940
with Genoa’s victory). It is strange, but the SS officer paid a lot of money for it. The battle
took place on September 9, 1298. Knowing this will be very useful at the end of this scenario.
Montaperti is a chatty, social fellow.
    Jack – Drunken Hitler: The party walks into a small lounge. In front of the fireplace stands
the Führer himself! But they have seen him minutes before in the main hall! The man claims to
be the “real” Hitler, while the one in the main hall is only a look-alike, acting as his double in
public to avoid murder attempts. This “Hitler” (who is actually the look-alike, used to distract
potential killers during the trip from Berlin to Mespelbrunn), is very drunk and sentimental. He
starts talking nonsense about various matters (politics, his personal life, etc.). If the Operatives
don’t humor him, roll on the Reaction Table with no modifications. With an Uncooperative or
worse reaction he starts shouting wildly of treason! The party must stop him within two rounds;
otherwise, some SS soldiers storm in and arrest them!

and Noble Edges. See page 41.
    Queen – Lustful Kraut: Victor, a young SS soldier, is having an affair with Luzia, a
housemaid. The two are in a servants’ bedroom, making love. They are busy in bed and have
left their clothes (a housemaid outfit and an SS uniform) on a chair. The garments can be used
as a disguise! Sneaky Operatives can creep into the room and steal them (Stealth roll opposed
by the lovers’ Notice), while brasher ones can rush in, threaten the couple with weapons, and
lock them in a wardrobe.

      CHAPTER SEVEN:


       Equipment
      It’s true that a warrior can’t lean on a shiny suit of armor and a magic blade to ensure his victory.
      Instead, he needs to use smart tactics and his proven fighting techniques to win. But that doesn’t mean
      that one’s equipment is any less important in Iron Heroes than in other roleplaying games. If anything,
      it’s more important.

   Style descriptors indicate how you use a weapon. A short-
sword and a greatsword are both swords, but the shortsword
is a fast, stabbing weapon while the greatsword is a massive,
hacking one. Their shape is similar, but the methods used to
wield them differ.

(the classifications mentioned above), identifies the difficulty
inherent in learning to use a particular weapon.

Lupines
     Picture an eight-foot-tall shag carpet soaked with
blood: yours. Add in a self-enforcing Masquerade that
makes every mortal who sees one start gibbering and hal-
lucinating about chainsaw-toting maniacs, gangbangers,
rogue cops or whatever other urban legend works best.
Now make it so that every time you hurt one, it heals
quicker than you can say “Oh shit, you’re not going to
tear me another new asshole, are you?”
     Congratulations. Now you have some slight inkling
of what Lupines are like. If you go out in the woods, you
run the risk of having one of death’s own guard dogs
pounce on your ass and use you for a target practice. By
“woods” I mean anywhere without streetlights. Lucky for
us, the shapechangers are allergic to cities, by and large.
     I remember the day Gene Wharton, a Gangrel from
way back, got turned practically inside out and hung
on the doors of Miami’s Elysium. I took one look and
thought “Now that’s what the Masquerade is for. Fuck
the mortals; I’m hiding from the werewolves!”

Faeries
     These things seem to be kind of like soul parasites
on human beings. They hate all of our kind, which is
a damn shame because they seem drawn to civilization
like moths to fire. Sound like anyone you know? I heard

and a dusty and torn map leading to “The Lost Treasure of Nal-Akura“ (This last everyone will recognise
