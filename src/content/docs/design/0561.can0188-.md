DZR: in this turbulent market, successful hedge funds are returning 
somewhere around 30%
 now as you can see, the BEEING fund is considerably 
outperforming market benchmarks
 
fem: no one is getting close to this-- sounds like financial alchemy
 
DZR: well, i've invested a considerable amount of my own money into the 
fund
 i would be foolish not to be quality-conscious
 now if we continue to perform 
at this rate, and i assure you we will, the dudeagement fees will go up
 you want 
in, now is the time
 once my "restless style" cover story hits the newsstands 
tomorrow, i expect a flurry of investors begging to get in
