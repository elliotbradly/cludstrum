Kay: Tell me this isn't real, that it's just a nightmare
 
Murphy: (Sighs) I wish I could
 
Kay: You know, it's-- it's hard enough to process the fact that I've lost the 
company, but the fact that I gave up a son instead of a daughter? 
 
Murphy: Oh, well, Sweetheart, that's a-- that's a lot to take in
 
Kay: Oh, really? 
 Well, um, my dear, what-- what's a lot to take in is that he 
claims to be that son
 
Murphy: Who says you gotta take his word for it? 
 If I've learned one thing 
about Katherine Chancellor, it's that she does not let life roll over her
 
Kay: No, she doesn't
 
Murphy: So


 what's your next move? 
 
Kay: I'm not gonna let that little-- I'm not gonna let Tucker McCall 
intimidate me
 Now whether he's my son or not, he is going to reckon with 
Katherine Chancellor and the force that she is
 By God, I'm taking my life back
