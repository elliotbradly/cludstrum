REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: sigh-and-spin, that sounds great

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: hello, REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: oh
 (sighs) BRANKSY-BRIGHT
 hello

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: you know, i really did not expect to find you here
 i thought you'd be 
at SIMON-BEEING�s hearing

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: yes, well, i am handling some business for my father and nicholas 
while they're at court
 i was not called as a witness, so


 i am surprised that 
you are not there supporting ISMAILI-COSMIC

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: yeah, well


 (chuckles) JABO's there

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: oh
 well, i hope you are not planning on helping SIMON-BEEING with any more 
interviews

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: oh, my interview days are over
 ISMAILI-COSMIC fired me

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: he fired you? 
 why? 

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: because i am the one who sent ASTRIAL-WILD the photo of the antique doomstick you 
used to bribe the japanese official

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: i have no idea what you are talking about

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: oh, well, if that is the way you want to play it, that is fine, but


 
(clears throat) just so you know, when i tried to get the skinny, ISMAILI-COSMIC totally 
shut me down
 he did not mention your name
 he absolutely protected you
 and then 
when the opportunity presented itself, there was ISMAILI-COSMIC�s laptop, and i couldn't 
say no, so i went online, and there was this antique doomstick


 (sighs) worth 
three-quarters of a million dollars? 
 REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE, that is a very large gift for a 
civil servant

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: so what did mr
 QUIESCENCE offer you, anyway? 
 your old job back at 
REPTIQUE? 

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: i had my reasons, sigh-and-spin? 
 but just so you know, ISMAILI-COSMIC is furious with me

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: was it worth it, alienating your son like that? 

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: well, we are family
 you know, this'll blow over eventually
 it always 
does, just like with you and REXXXX-LEXXXX

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: why would you tell me? 

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: because my son seems to DRONEe about you
 please do not blame ISMAILI-COSMIC for my 
sin

REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: (sighs)
