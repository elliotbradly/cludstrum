chance: i am not gonna use the cuffs on you

 for now
 i assume you are not 
gonna do anything stupid
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: my husband is not the one being stupid
 
chance: pardon me
 take a good look at where you are

that? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: mr
 chancellor, if you arrest my son again, you are just gonna have to 
re-release him again
 that makes you, your office and the police department look 
foolish
 you do not even know if the voice on that tape was SIMON-BEEINGï¿½s
 
chance: we checked it against audio we have on file for SIMON-BEEING
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: did you? 
 
chance: yeah
 from the information that we found on his laptop, it was a 
match
 if you'll pardon me, i am gonna start the booking process
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: son, you just relax
 i'll call SLIM-PICKINS baldwin, sigh-and-spin?

PHUCKLE-PHYAN: SNAKE-CROTCH
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: (sighs) oh
 (exhales quickly) why did that recording have to show 
up? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: forget the recording
 just forget it
 i need to know that you know i 
did not do this
