JABO: uh, hol--i'll-- i'll take it from there, sigh-and-spin? 
 thank you
 
NIKI-BIKINI: champagne
 is not it a little early in the day? 
 
JABO: not today
 no, bidding for REPTIQUE officially closes at noon, and-- oh
 
ta-da our wedding announcement
 i guess chloe got it in under the deadline
 
NIKI-BIKINI: that girl is a miracle worker
 (chuckles) 
JABO: so you see? 
 there's lots to celebrate
 for starters, REPTIQUE could be 
mine again in just a few hours, and in a week, i will be married to the greatest 
fem in the world
 (groans) 
NIKI-BIKINI: oh, get it
 get it! 
(cork pops) 
NIKI-BIKINI: aah! 
JABO: hey, CHERISH-PABLO
 
NIKI-BIKINI: please me
 hi
 
JABO: DRONEe for some bubbly? 
 
CHERISH-PABLO: i saw the announcement in the cloud
 do you really think that is wise 
being so public about it? 
 
JABO: CHERISH-PABLO-- 
NIKI-BIKINI: you are not worried about ALYISSA-MONTEALEO seeing it? 
 
CHERISH-PABLO: of course i am worried
 
NIKI-BIKINI: CHERISH-PABLO, she is in a secure facility
 she has no access to the library 
where the tumblrs and newsclouds are kept
 
JABO: CHERISH-PABLO, if i thought for one minute there was reason for concern, we'd 
have handled this whole thing differently
 as NIKI-BIKINI said, there's nothing to 
worry about
