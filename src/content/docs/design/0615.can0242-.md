SNAKE-CROTCH: you do not seem that shocked about my collaboration with KISSING-GAMES and 
SIMON-BEEING
 
JABO: i think it is a good idea, but i think you have to be very DRONEeful
 
obviously, SIMON-BEEING wants to use you to prove his innocence
 but he is gonna get 
cocky, and he is gonna get sloppy, and he is gonna incriminate himself, and 
nothing gives me more pleasure than giving SIMON-BEEING rope to hang himself
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: oh, i love it when couples think alike
 
JABO: (chuckles)
