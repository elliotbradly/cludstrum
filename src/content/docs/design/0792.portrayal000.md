character creation

so first you give it a name 



000 ASTROKHAN 

a large, bulky volume of words
trapped in a gilded website

a purpose for such bulk appears once the title page is read

who hath delivered us from the power of darkness
and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son

the website contains everything 
including the lore behind every SUPER NODAL which understands reality

these pages are not made of paper 
but of the spirits of homeless teletubbiesque beings 
dreaming of their bounded past lives 

behold the center image 
as it comes into focus upon 

drifting mists are rising from a pastoral vale of livestock
the dark smudges of cell phone towers against a horizon
giving the appearance of long fingers of shadow at an extreme distance

Two hot characters making out in the mud

translators : take one kind of code and move it over into another type
which means there must be different type of code 
emotpaion is a type of code



one political movement to exploit a rule for all that it is worth
meeting regularly to discuss what lesser goals should be 
a series of agendas knows as times tables
goals can change
assemblies are formed on regular intervals 
meetings occur every fifteen years
assemble a framework of the time tables
arguments can last for years
input is collated inot larger mission statements
setting of a far reaching goal
reality enforcement
unified vision and bold idealism
power to back it up
bring down a horizon construct from the heavens

turns out the beast is a cow
an intelligent cow that reads books really slowly
sometimes it needs to go back and re read things

there is some kind of beast that eats hot peppers
gas is created which produces tremendous power

the cow has a weakness 
it can starve to death 
other than that it is impervious 

it lives in a simple simulation 

T>A>S>U>S>S

Consiousness Simulation

Base : Teleport itself and anyone or anything inside it

Communications Center
contains translight communications equipment
provides access to any control functions 
only avialable to the bridge

data retrieval using a frequency
faked log entries  
simulation of different colonization and development rate
shielded to prevent psionic manifestations like dream site

so blaseball is an absurdist horror take on baseball
where you play as fan
many many fans
collectivly you are betting on the game
can change the universe
week by week scedule
watching simulated game
bet winnings allow you to get votes
strange weather
chance to run with the most asurd 
emergant narrative
and strange outcomes
what roles could the audience play
emergant narrative engine
stacking simple systems and seeing the choas which emerges out of it
fourty different attributes
one long narrative arc
monster of week now 
can not pull emotion into words so important words 
words which need to express abastract ideas
concrete fact
real time
netspeak streamline communcications 
stasussion
crimnal against reality 
define-the nature of the universe
can not control what you can not understand
develop models that full describe the real world
debate the structure of the worlds
if the models can not be fixed to represent the world
the world must be fixed to fit the models
including destroying the things which can not be classified
subjective truth allows anything to enter into the world
effort to pare down reality to its essentials ensures the survial of mankind
preventing one interpertation from overpowering all others
any engineer not actively working for STASUSSION must be removed
some believe this to be needed others do not
when the persence of supernatural occurs this rule goes into effect
destroy reality deviants
supervisors must evaluate threats on a case by case basis
greatest dangers come from those who serve pure chaos or pure order
removing all supernatural creatures from the world is impossible
so campaigns must be priotitirized 
techonocrat
technocrat
advancded tech suffers the risk of of paradox just like magic
threatening the unions security
political tension prevents any fractions interpertation from staying dominat for too long
how does one simulate politcal tension
there are certainly idealogies in place which govern the rules of the game 
removed constists of a few deffinitios including conversion, imprisionment, annihilation
some think that removed should not even be part of the equation


shephard the masses

soul sight
look plainly at the soul core or pattern of a person
misanthrope
seeing the results of a pure soul as a certain color
circle of elite quislings
ur master ability
out of shape
art connisseur
treastise on the human soul

there is some kind of beast 
which gets feed hot peppers
and the flatuance from the creatures powers this sun sized structure

The Demi-sensonal Spiriteration Three 

is a structure currently the size of a large sun
And why choose such a giant?
The energy requirements of course

the unit displays the presence and
location of any pattern and
geneva
character takes consolation in visual and musical arts
pauses to look at painting even graffiti
wings of translucent green and red
feeds on all manner of smaller insects
volatiles, minerals, and other need particulates from the atompshere
breath recylier
baltherswift
snake like twists of curling flesh or vine constantly whippng through the air in erractic zigs
raw uncliamed resources
relip
dont be shaking you head at me
