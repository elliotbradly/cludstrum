―[Urag gro-Shub](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Urag_gro-Shub "Urag gro-Shub")[[src]](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim")

**Fetch Me That Book!** is a [quest](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Quests_\(Skyrim\) "Quests (Skyrim)") available in _[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim")_. This is a [College of Winterhold](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/College_of_Winterhold_\(Skyrim\) "College of Winterhold (Skyrim)") radiant quest where the [Dragonborn](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Dragonborn "Last Dragonborn") needs to find a semi-random [book](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Books_\(Skyrim\) "Books (Skyrim)") from a random dungeon.

## Objectives[](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Fetch_Me_That_Book!?veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Objectives")

1. Find the copy of the book
2. Return the book to Urag gro-Shub

## Walkthrough[](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Fetch_Me_That_Book!?veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Walkthrough")

After completing the quest "[First Lessons](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/First_Lessons "First Lessons")," the Dragonborn can enter the College of Winterhold and find [Urag gro-Shub](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Urag_gro-Shub "Urag gro-Shub") inside [The Arcanaeum](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Arcanaeum "The Arcanaeum"):

**Is there any College business I can assist with?** _"If you're feeling adventurous, I'm always looking for someone to procure valuable books from some more... dangerous locations."_

**I'm ready for some adventure** _"Well all right. Here, I scribbled down the last place I'd heard about. Check it out, but be careful."_

**I'm not really interested in anything dangerous** _"Ah. Some other time, perhaps?"_

**Note:** The quest will not start if the Dragonborn declines or leaves the conversation before accepting.

He will then give a quest to retrieve a random book out of this list, that can be found inside a random boss-level [chest](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Containers_\(Skyrim\) "Containers (Skyrim)") in any dungeon in the game, even if it was cleared before. It is best to avoid picking them up from the boss-level chests before this quest is started, as doing so may result in a serious bug (see [Bugs section](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Fetch_Me_That_Book!#Bugs)). The books that need to be obtained in a given random order are:

- _[Arcana Restored](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Arcana_Restored "Arcana Restored")_
- _[Brothers of Darkness](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Brothers_of_Darkness "Brothers of Darkness")_
- _[Children of the Sky](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Children_of_the_Sky "Children of the Sky")_
- _[Chimarvamidium](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Chimarvamidium "Chimarvamidium")_
- _[Chronicles of Nchuleft](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Chronicles_of_Nchuleft "Chronicles of Nchuleft")_
- _[Cleansing of the Fane](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Fane "Cleansing of the Fane")_
- _[Fragment: On Artaeum](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Fragment:_On_Artaeum "Fragment: On Artaeum")_
- _[Glories and Laments](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Glories_and_Laments "Glories and Laments")_
- _[Hanging Gardens](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Hanging_Gardens "Hanging Gardens")_`
