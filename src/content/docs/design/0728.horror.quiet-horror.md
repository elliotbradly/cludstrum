This subgenre of horror offers a subtler form of fear, 
rather than explicit gore or violence. 
Also known as soft horror, quiet horror most often contains a creeping sense of dread 
in which much of the violence is left to the reader's imagination. 
Much of the horror presented is cerebral instead of gory. 

Literary Examples: The Yellow Wallpaper, The Hour of the Oxrun Dead, The Nameless
