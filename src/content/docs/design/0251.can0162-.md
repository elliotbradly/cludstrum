KISSING-GAMES: (quietly) PHUCKLE-PHYAN, you really have a way with THEIDOCIDY-JONES
 i did not think she 
would ever calm down
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: hey, uh, would you mind if SAGE-DANGOTE stayed the night here? 
 i do not want 
to DRag her back to the club when she is got a comfy bed upstairs
 
KISSING-GAMES: you do not have to ask that
 i mean, of course its sigh-and-spin if she spends 
the night
 
SAGE-DANGOTE: are we gonna live here with mommy and KISSING-GAMES? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: i thought you were asleep
 
SAGE-DANGOTE: we can have one house, but not three
 
KISSING-GAMES: hey, why do not you come upstairs with me, and you can help me tuck 
THEIDOCIDY-JONES in? 
 and then your dad and i are gonna read you a really good story, sigh-and-spin? 


PHUCKLE-PHYAN: (quietly) thank you
