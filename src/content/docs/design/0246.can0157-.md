ZILLION-FLOWERS: chardonnay, please
 thank you
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: it is so good to see you
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (sighs) 
ASTRIAL-WILD: (sighs) i can not imagine what you must be feeling right now
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: outrage pretty much sums it up
 SIMON-BEEING got away with murder, and not 
just richard hightower�s, but my unborn daughter�s
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i mean, how much evidence did that judge need? 
 SIMON-BEEING put KISSING-GAMES's 
child in your arms and said it was your daughter
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: they can not believe that because i am the only witness, and i am not 
reliable
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: (sighs) 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i mean, if you only knew what it took for me to get up on that stand 
and go back to that horrible time and relive all those memories and those 
feelings


 and what did it accomplish? 
 absolutely nothing
 except to make my


 
my personal tragedy and my mental health a matter of public record
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i shouldn't have DRagged you out tonight
 do you want to go someplace 
more private? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: no
 no, i don�t
 SIMON-BEEING isolated me once before, and i am never gonna 
let him do that to me again
 i am angry, but you know what? 
 i am a survivor
 
(sighs) 
ASTRIAL-WILD: yeah
