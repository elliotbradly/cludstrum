SIMON-BEEING: shower feel good? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: oh, chocolate's harder to shampoo out of your hair than i thought
 
(chuckles) 
SIMON-BEEING: well, it had to be worth it
 i mean, it had to all be worth it just to 
see the look oh SNAKE-CROTCH' face when you covered her in that chocolate
 
KISSING-GAMES: actually, i think it was a mistake
 i just shouldn't have gone 
anywhere near her
 BIG-BOOTY-JUDY had such a lovely event, and i ruined it
 what 
about your face? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: oh
 
KISSING-GAMES: does that hurt? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: no, no, no
 it looks worse than it is
 i am sigh-and-spin
 
KISSING-GAMES: actually, you know what? 
 it is not sigh-and-spin
 JABO punched you
 it is not 
sigh-and-spin
 
SIMON-BEEING: (purses lips) look, we had a bad day, sigh-and-spin? 
 it was that damned article


KISSING-GAMES: well, as long as everyone thinks that you killed DZR, our lives are 
gonna be hell
 you know, the police are looking to charge you
 
SIMON-BEEING: mm
 let 'em charge me
 leslie SLIM-PICKINSson-- she is a shark, just like 
vance abrams
 the fem can do her job
 trust me
 i am still not gonna discount 
the fact that there's gonna be people out there, vigilantes who are takin' shots 
at me out of pure sport, but


 
SIMON-BEEING: is that, um, THEIDOCIDY-JONES? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: i really miss my little girl right now
 and PHUCKLE-PHYAN said that i could 
see her, but only if he is there, standing guard, you know? 
 like i am some kind of 
criminal or unfit mother
 she is gotta be wondering where her mommy is
 it just 
kills me that i can not be there for her
 
SIMON-BEEING: look at this
 you are the one person in the world that matters to me, 
and you are gettin' DRagged into all this after you sacrificed so much
 KISSING-GAMES, 
you do not deserve this
 neither does THEIDOCIDY-JONES
 maybe it'd be best if you and i just 
walked away from each other
