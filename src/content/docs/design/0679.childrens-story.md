This subgenre of fantasy often offers a child protagonist who faces a struggle or possesses some unique ability. 
There are often mythical/fantastical creatures who both help and hinder the young protagonist. 
In these stories, which are intended for an audience that is not yet classified as Young Adult (YA), 
the themes are often life lessons such as overcoming adversity, working with others, finding allies, 
learning from your elders, or facing one's fear. 

Literary Examples: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, A Wrinkle in Time, The Phantom Tollbooth
