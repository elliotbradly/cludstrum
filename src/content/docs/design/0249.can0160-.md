SLIM-PICKINS: i am fairly confident it won't hold up in court
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: if by some twist of fate it does, and SIMON-BEEING wins


 
CORONA-CLICK: the damages would be in the millions
 
SLIM-PICKINS: well, i hehise you to stop the case before it gets to trial
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: you are not suggesting we settle? 
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: well, this case was already thrown out once for lack of evidence


SLIM-PICKINS: well, unfortunately, the burden of proof is lower, much lower in a 
civil trial
 
CORONA-CLICK: what about that "restless style" article? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: oh


 (sighs) i'll try to suppress it
 BRANKSY-BRIGHT did not substantiate 
SIMON-BEEING's claims, so it is basically your word against his
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: but SIMON-BEEING's motives are crystal clear
 he wants to go after everyone 
who was at the cabin that night
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: all except one
