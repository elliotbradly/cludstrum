A subgenre in which it is assumed aliens or otherworldly beings originally ruled our planet 
and will someday return to destroy all of humanity. 
It is fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (or unknowable) 
more than gore or other elements of shock, 
and is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890â€“1937), 
who was one of the first authors to explore the genre. 

Literary Examples: A Study in Emerald, Sherlock Holmes and the Shadwell Shadows, The Rhesus Chart
