In this subgenre of science fiction, 
the world as we know it is different due to alternate events 
taking place in history. 

There is often "what if" scenarios that occur 
at important points in history and present outcomes 
that are different than what's on historical record.


Literary Examples: The Man in the High Castle, 11/22/63, The Red Garden
