He had alot of things in his head 
He just needed to get them all out 
THoughts were on money, self, christainity

What did he have to do
Create ART
PROFIT


Make sure you have good footing
He was ready to go but all these people got in his way

A Bad spirit entered inside him
Good spirit come in

Brad you are going to need to shake off an attachment to the body

The Massie Ferganson Tractor Beam released Billy Fae Bots at a calm and peaceful 44 miles above Theta 
Immediately loving gravity began pulling softly on her tight organic curves 
The race began
She saw some of this on her long thin wounded arm
On the screen she only noticed an immense poppy field of stars
Billy Fae Bots felt at peace inside this world living on the Glass^tm attached her wrist
After many expierences in New Eden she always rememebered to drink GlopRatchet
Also she know her body would evenutally fall from all this beauty
KBAR the Endless wrathfully reminded her to observe the rules of the race
She needed to slow her falling body down to a speed of 144 meters per second 
On then could her responsibility be safely dropped into a nest  
If all went smoothly the alligator snapping turtle egg inside her would hatch

The hoverboard glided through the air like a honey bee
The train chew chewed its way through the fog of the swamp
Billie Faie Bots felt so free 
The wind passed through her hot pink hair 
Boom went a mosquito straight into her eye 
She let out a little sigh 
She had killed something which conflicted with her buddist philosphies
Still there would be plenty of time after the race
An engine of the train continued to pick up speed
It had just passed through a crossing
Two arms with glowing red light fell down block all traffic which may dream of passing through
Once she imagined the arms being the gates of hell 
It happend during a night before Halloween
She dressed up like an asshole that night
The asshole was a mexican wrestler
She purchased the mask from an antigue store in Seattle Washingtion
her girlfreind at the time dressed up like a horse
Bill Fae bots remembered the heat those leather pants caused all night
She wrestled noone that night not even her lover
Yes, the was a missing feeling in her heart now the only lover wanted her no more
The horn of the train knocked her out of dream of long past joy
A race between equals continued on
Spooge in between puff of green smoke had primed the engine well
Billy Fea Bots couldnt remember the hoverboard going so fast before
Maybe this would be the race to win
Her Heads Up display told her she had 4.4 miles to go
She remembered starting the morning off so exicited about this adventure
No while squarely in the middle of it she questioned all her feelings
The expierence itself seemed so exciting in her memory
Now the reality of it all around her brought out the drerpessive demons which seemed to follow her
The where call the PussPack
They were ugly horrible and mean
Where they came from she didnt know but they whrere always around her making her feel bad and sad and even mad
Her grand father was a poet and he did know it
Dont use the break 
Dont use the break
She kept telling herself over and over 
She looked at the speedometter on her neon fuscha head up display
She was making so many mistakes
Fouty miles an hour aproaching
She could get fify easy if she didnt make so many mistakes
The first mistake she made was visting the trailer of her drug dealing buddy
She wanted him to offer her some smoke so the race would go better
She alwasy imagined that the drugs made her smarter faster better
and they did
She remember people telling her this over and over through out her life
Her cousin the first was the last to share this piece of information 
She could make people laugh when she enjoyed the smoke
Fify miles an hour approached
Could she do it
Go go go go

A voice screamed in her head
She could see the the cross bars closing up ahead

She would ne
