Okay, here is the `entity.md` template recontextualized using the "Alligator Alley" Franchise Bible as the reference material. I've created an example entity – a Master Chef – to demonstrate how the protocol would be applied to build a character deeply rooted in that specific heterocosm.

# Story World Codex: Entity Constitution Protocol (Property Bundle Method)
# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica III.B.II

**World:** Alligator Alley
**Codex Version:** 1.0 - Entity Definition (AA Adaptation)
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Lead Architect(s):** [Transmedia IP Development Team Lead / Alligator Alley Story Group]

## Introduction: Building Entities from Authenticated Attributes

*This protocol guides the detailed definition of entities within the **Alligator Alley** heterocosm using Doležel's principle that fictional entities **ARE** constituted by the **bundle of properties authenticated for them** by the authoritative narrative source (i.e., this Codex, the Alligator Alley Franchise Bible, and core narrative texts).*

*Instead of relying on vague descriptions or assuming hidden depths, this method involves **explicitly listing the key authenticated properties** across diverse categories that collectively **define** the entity's nature, function, and reality within this world. Properties not listed are considered **undefined (undersaturated)** unless later authenticated by the Central Authenticational Authority (CAA).*

*Focus on **authentication**: Only list properties considered 'true' or factual *for Alligator Alley* based on creative decisions outlined in the Franchise Bible. Use comments `#` for notes, potential developments, or subjective perceptions attributed *to other characters* about this entity.*

    *   `- Material/Texture: [Wears the traditional high-collared, swamp-russet chef's jacket of her Guild, made from treated marsh-cotton – practical yet conveying authority. Her apron is often stiff with dried spices and rendered gator fat.]`
    *   `- Sensory_Scent: [A complex aroma of smoked paprika, fen-herbs, scorched gator hide, and the metallic tang of sharpened blades. Faint undercurrent of the Gilded Cleaver's signature incense (myrrh & dried swamp lily).]`

    *   `- Key_Disvalues: [Abhors waste of any part of the 'Swamp Tyrant.' Despises culinary shortcuts or the use of inferior, non-authenticated swamp spices.]`
    *   `# - Undefined: Her opinion on the aesthetic value of, say, poacher-derived goods or non-culinary gator crafts.`

### Summary: Entity Essence Profile

*Purpose: Briefly synthesize the core identity emerging from the property bundle.*

*   **Core Essence:** `Chef Mireille Moreau is constituted as a supremely skilled and deeply traditional Master Chef of Alligator Alley's culinary elite. Her identity is forged by the Gilded Cleaver Guild's doctrines, her "Ancestral Palate," and an unwavering dedication to perfecting the art of 'Swamp Tyrant' cuisine. She embodies the cultural reverence for reptilian meat, and her existence is a direct product of a world where the alligator, not the cow, defines haute cuisine and societal status.`
*   **Primary Narrative Function:** `To represent the established culinary order and its traditions. To act as a potential mentor, obstacle, or source of deep world knowledge regarding gator cuisine and Guild politics. To showcase the sensory richness and cultural depth of Alligator Alley's core premise through her craft.`
*   **Key Internal Contradiction (if any):** `Her deep respect for tradition versus a nascent, suppressed desire to innovate beyond strict Guild lines; her austere professional demeanor versus a fierce, almost spiritual passion for her ingredients and craft.`
