DORIAN : What has happen?
DORIAN : Mother!
DORIAN : Mother, is she ok?
DORIAN : Mother, is everything fine?
REXXIE : Yes, she is safe.
DORIAN : Oh, thank you Jesus.
REXXIE : You can thank him again after I share some good information about your current status.
REXXIE : You have been freed for a little while.
DORIAN : I am out?
REXXIE : Yes.
DORIAN : Tell me about Blangus?
REXXIE : The autorities have him now.
DORIAN : So he was caught.
REXXIE : Yes.
DORIAN : When will all this be over.
REXXIE : He is in Detroit Memorial.
REXXIE : A strange quirk of fate gave him a terrible car accident.
DORIAN: I thought that was impossible now.
REXXIE : Its a mystery and my sources tell me that the surgeons are not sure if he will live.
DORIAN : Understood.
DORIAN : Take me over there, please.
REXXIE : Why would that be best?
REXXIE : I would think you would want to see Kissing Games first?
DORIAN : The truth dies with him.
DORIAN : Unless you enjoy our little visits here.
DORIAN : He will talk.
DORIAN : Every function depends on it.
REXXIE : Let us jet.
JENET : What about me, Red, huh?
JENET : Remember I helped you?
DORIAN : No, I will not forget
DORIAN: Right now its time to secure my freedom not yours.
JENET : When you are done you will find me still here, Red!
JENET : Rush return, asshole!
