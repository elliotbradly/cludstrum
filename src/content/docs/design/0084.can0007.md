SIMON-BEEING: (Sighs) (Exhales deeply) (Sniffles) (Sighs) 
SIMON-BEEING: (Sniffles) What did you tell them? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Exactly what I saw
 Two men were arguing and one ran into the 
street, got hit
 
SIMON-BEEING: That's unbelievable
 That poor guy
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Yeah
 How do you know him? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: It's Ashley's obstetrician
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Why were you fighting with him? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: (Sniffles) (Sighs) I can see how it looked that way to you
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Well, I know what I saw, SIMON-BEEING
 
Man: Excuse me, Sir
 I understand that you were arguing with the victim 
before he was hit? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: Uh, yeah, I was talking with him
 
Man: So you witnessed the accident? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: Yeah, I did
 I saw it
 And I'm legally blind, but I-I saw everything, 
yeah
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: He's legally blind, but he was standing right here when it happened


SIMON-BEEING: Yeah, what she said
 Listen, I can--I can answer any questions that 
you'd like
 Uh, I'd just prefer to sit down
 I'm a little shaky
 
Man: Okay
