the timberline branch thurday night revial 

singing 
blue hymnal 
man with big head little hair 
last shaven four days ago 
plump around the belly 
weak around the chest 

he began by further installing caution concerning the enemy 

man from nineteen sixties gospel band 
corduroy suit 
hair that puffs up into the shape of a cushion
missing all teeth in the back but had teeth in front 
soul filled with joy 
hung sheet rock 
expierenced a healing which gave him strength 

the sweet phrase of bless him lord from shortly off distance
the a cappella rendition of it is well with in my soul 
my soul could find peace there 

the poetry  
the spontanous poetry emerging from thier blessed lips 

an over flowing fifty galloon dream of hank williams tapes 
burning at four thirty in the morning then goin to work at six
equals one saved life 
the holy spirit did not show that morning but appeared a  few days later 

then a jump on the bench then then the grand pronouncement
no do put yourself up on an alter 
and the confusion around if you can even remember some memories right 

then from a short moment of silence 
a poetry more sophesticate than the others emerge 
are their patterns to discern here 

then the translation in a alarming voice containing brass
but the words of God have been faded for you 

then the mother who prayed her son out of the jaws of an alligator 
the scars the five year cared about where not the fearsome teeth marks on his legs 
no clawmarks on his arms are what made the church cry 

the great hallelujah man who officated the proceedings 
remembers you family with a smile 

paul healing the beggar 
the visual image of the beggar not even looking in the face of paul when making the request 
do not be a beggar 
cause i beggar can not give anything back to the church 



all right you wanna bee 
a writer 

now write 

do not talk about yourself 

imagine some mythical location 
place your characters there 
keep your hands moving and to not get up and go lay down 


all right 
let us go suffer with a mind who is not functioning proper
but you have the house all to you self 
maybe inspiration will come if you only lite one more candle 

for give me mother for the expense
but you wanted three so you got three 

my life sits in a nighmare 

i imagine this as the buzz saw hacks its way into a bedroom 
which 
as of last week and a day was perfectly adquite 

the brain i once used has turned to mush 
perhaps 
due to a four day fever 

remeber that 

conversation with art hallow
it is not something i can just turn off 

the illusion of work 

the roof is leaking 
how stupid is it to expand a bedroom when the roof is leaking 

we built this great city 
you built it on our back 
cause you have no rational imagination 

sigh and spin 
where do we leave off 

trigger a religious war 

all simon beeing wants is money 

character creation screen 

you tube videos 
you make a character 
then you sit back and watch a movie unfold 


you could choose to be invisible 

alligator delivery systems 

simon just wants to make money 

the perfect path 
but we want somthing on top of that 

oh a screen play 

oh a really do not know what you are talking about 

story of the cow that never recovered

you got to have conflict

boy does not want to turn into a wrapper with rotten teeth 
his cousin
the rapper who did not make it 
made it for one brief moment 


for a smart man 
alan moore plays with his hair too much 

how do you communicate that the left is anti christian 

what is you point 

where are you going 


the blank canvas 
white 
unlike supremecy 
a black  face screams 
there are beautiful side scoller rock and grass imagery 
a girl walks past with beautiful legs and a sexy walk 
the man sits on a throne stern 
the beautiful blonde girl looks off to the side 
the techno warrior has gotten sick 
while out in the feild checking the cucumbers 
a alligator dragon flies by to deliever a package 
a green panther sits in the shadows of the field waiting to strike 
does the character survive 
who is the girl with the bright green hair standing in front of the pinball table 
the black plotician 
a beautiful girl surrouned by friends 
the wolf verses the panther 
the conflict 
the struggles 
beautiful old man in a red happy jacket

there is the black smiling creature 
its gums are pink and its eyes and teeth are white 
and you run for the safety 
the rebel flag 
black man holding the head of a little boy
obama sucking on something 

the guilt of the illegel immigrant 

american flag 
anime girl so cute 

a family of a young man with big bright teeth 
he holds his child 

girls girls girls 

then a dark man with a weapon 

the job at the railroad 
the coveted prize 


go go jewerly 
saint simons 

March of 9th 

wine whisky and wildlife
