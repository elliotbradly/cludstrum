A subgenre of fantasy depicting a realistic world, 
where magic is often present but not necessarily so. 
This is in contrast to High Fantasy, 
which occurs in a fictional world with magical elements present. 
The word "low" is in reference to the prominence of traditional fantasy elements within the work, 
rather than being a remark on the work's quality. 

Literary Examples: The Indian in the Cupboard, Lies Ripped Open, Tiger's Dream
