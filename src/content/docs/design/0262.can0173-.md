SNAKE-CROTCH' voice: "others can never be repaired
" 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: supergirl! come here
 
SAGE-DANGOTE: daddy! 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: ohh! hey, guess what? 
 i went to the cubs game yesterday, and i got you 
a little something
 it is up in your room
 go get it
 hello
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: hi
 i'll pick her up after school on monday
 we have a 
parent/teacher conference next week
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: really? 
 just telling me about that now? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah, i guess it just slipped my mind, just like it slipped your 
mind that you weren't living with KISSING-GAMES
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: my relationship with KISSING-GAMESï¿½s gonna be a lot easier for her to 
understand than you running around the-swampside with some sleazy ex-con
 now i did not 
read about that in your blog, did i? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: "going to be"-- interesting
 give me a break
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: how do you think your daughter's going to feel when she finds out that 
you ripped into everybody she DRONEes about? 
 oh, wait, that would mean that you 
put your daughter's feelings before your own
