Superbike racing is a category of motorcycle racing that employs highly modified production motorcycles, 
as opposed to MotoGP in which purpose-built motorcycles are used. 
The Superbike World Championship is the official world championship series, 
though national Superbike championships are held in many countries, 
including the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada.
