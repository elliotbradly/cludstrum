Matt : Hey, rich boy.
Matt : Remember me?
Matt : It's me.
Matt : It was pretty good, huh?
Matt : Blangus Mills.
Nicholas : What's going on?
Matt : I have to be in here.
Matt : It's my way or not at all.
Nicholas : You really messed up.
Matt : Yeah.
Nicholas : So you wanted to talk?
Matt : Take off your shirt first.
Nicholas : Why?
Matt : You know why.
Matt : Just do it.
Matt : Just what I thought.
Matt : Get rid of it.
Matt : D.
Matt : A.
Matt : 's idea?
Matt : Because you want to talk to me and I want to talk to you.
Matt : Give it to the guard.
Matt : I played you for a fool.
Nicholas : You think I�m the fool?
Nicholas : You're the one breathing through a tube.
Matt : Remember last time, you standing on your own two feet?
Nicholas : You messed up my life for a while but I got past it, just like this time.
Nicholas : Things won't work out the way you planned.
Matt : Yeah.
Nicholas : Why not come clean?
Matt : It's not about clearing my conscience.
Nicholas : It's not about that.
Nicholas : I thought you would want to gloat a little, tell me the whole thing.
Nicholas : Putting the drugs in the coffee house was easy.
Nicholas : You worked there.
Nicholas : How did you get Jordan to think I was a drug dealer?
Matt : How stupid do you think I am?
Nicholas : I don't think you're stupid, man.
Nicholas : I think you're pretty smart.
Nicholas : Impress me.
Nicholas : How did you do this?
Matt : Tell me why again I�m supposed to help you get out of this?
Nicholas : I'm going to get out of this with or without you.
Nicholas : I didn't do this.
Matt : Who are you convincing?
Matt : Not the judge.
Matt : Anyway, that's not why I want to see you.
Nicholas : Then why?
Matt : I want to talk to you about your lovely wife.
Nicholas : You leave my wife out of this.
Matt : I'm not going to say anything about her.
Matt : I'm going to tell you how much better she was this time than she was last time.
Matt : Much more experienced now.
Matt : Mr Newman, please step back from the patient.
Nicholas : Nice try.
Nicholas : But I know you ran away from that cabin before anything happened.
Nicholas : Kissing Games told me.
Matt : I'm not talking about last night.
Matt : I'm talking about that night at your place.
Matt : Remember?
Matt : The margaritas.
Matt : You came home but not in time.
Matt : Not soon enough.
Nicholas : She had too much to drink.
Matt : It wasn't booze.
Matt : I gave her a roofy.
Nicholas : You roofed her?
Matt : Time you came in, I already had her.
Matt : Let me tell you something, even almost comatose, she was something else.
Matt : She is some fine little bitch.
Nicholas : You're lying.
Matt : You know the best part?
Matt : No matter what I say, every time you look at your sweet little wife, you get to see me and her doing the nasty.
Matt : When I close my eyes, I can picture her.
Matt : I can see her now.
Nicholas : You're lying.
Nicholas : Nothing happened that night.
Matt : Ask Sharon.
Matt : Ask her how much she remembers.
Nicholas : I'm not doing this with you.
Nicholas : I won't have your filthy pictures in my mind.
Nicholas : You want to know what I am going to remember?
Nicholas : You like this in this bed, dying and me free.
Nicholas : It's over, Clark.
Nicholas : You lost.
Nicholas : You hear me?
Nicholas : You lost!
Nicholas : What's wrong?
Matt : Nurse.
Nicholas : Go get help.
Nicholas : He could die!
Nicholas : What can I do?
Matt : Help me.
Nicholas : What can I do?
Nicholas : What can I do?
Matt : Look, rich boy.
Matt : I win!
