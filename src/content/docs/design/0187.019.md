street, got hit
 
SIMON-BEEING: that is unbelievable
 that poor guy
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah
 how do you know him? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: it is ZILLION-FLOWERS's obstetrician
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: why were you fighting with him? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: (sniffles) (sighs) i can see how it looked that way to you
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: well, i know what i saw, SIMON-BEEING
 
dude: pardon me, sir
 i understand that you were arguing with the victim 
before he was hit? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: uh, yeah, i was talking with him
 
dude: so you witnessed the accident? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: yeah, i did
 i saw it
 and i am legally blind, but i-i saw everything, 
yeah
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: he is legally blind, but he was standing right here when it happened


SIMON-BEEING: yeah, what she said
 listen, i can--i can answer any questions that 
you'd like
 uh, i would just prefer to sit down
 i am a little shaky
 
dude: sigh-and-spin

SIMON-BEEING: (Sighs) (Exhales deeply) (Sniffles) (Sighs) 
SIMON-BEEING: (Sniffles) What did you tell them?

 Two men were arguing and one ran into the 
street, got hit
 
SIMON-BEEING: That's unbelievable
 That poor guy
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Yeah

SNAKE-CROTCH: Well, I know what I saw, SIMON-BEEING
 
Man: Excuse me, Sir
 I understand that you were arguing with the victim 
before he was hit? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: Uh, yeah, I was talking with him
 
Man: So you witnessed the accident? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: Yeah, I did

----- 
SNAKE-CROTCH: so KISSING-GAMES hardly batted an eyelash when i told her that SIMON-BEEING was 
lying
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: so he lied about MITHRAISM-TERRORISM
 i mean, shocker
 the dude lies about 
everything
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah
 mm, it is like you said earlier-- the whole thing reeks
 i 
mean, what, he just happens to be walking past jimmy's when MITHRAISM-TERRORISM just happens 
to be walking out of the bar? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: so you think they met up there? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah, do not you? 
 i mean, what, they just start arguing outside of 
the bar? 
 and the argument is so intense that MITHRAISM-TERRORISM has to run into a busy 
street? 
 i mean, that is how he died-- getting away from SIMON-BEEING
 there's a story 
here, and i think it needs to be uncovered
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: (chuckles) you sound like ISMAILI-COSMIC BRANKSY right now
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: why would you insult me like that? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: no, i, um, yeah, sigh-and-spin
 uh


 (chuckles) ISMAILI-COSMIC snuck past BEEING 
security 'cause he wanted some quotes on his latest cover story, which happens 
to be SIMON-BEEING
