The Very Basics

A Perfect Beeing
It does not has class in the same way
It does have archatype 
You may want to make 
a street samurai

You focus on two major compontents
attributes and skills
attributes give you adjectives
they tell you how strong, how smart
how beautiful you are 

your attributes give  

high agility needs high friction
does this make sense 

once a charcater is built with attributes and skills
then to do anything in the PERFECT BEEING UNIVERSE
they need to do a test
tests come in to different varities
opposed test  or a threshold test 

to figure out how many dice to roll
they take attributes or skills together to figure how many numbers she gets

a noun is something you can put a number too
