ASTRIAL-WILD: couldn't be saved
 (sighs) 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: what are you talking about? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: my shirt, the one you dumped your DRink all over
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: (sighs) 
ASTRIAL-WILD: it is ruined
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: send me the bill, or better yet, run me a tab
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: darlin', i think you are confusing me with a bartender


 again
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: i liked you so much better as the bartender
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: (chuckles) tell me something
 if i were to make you that same 
cocktail i made for you that night, would you sit down and DRink it with me, or 
would i end up wearin' it? 
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: (chuckles)
