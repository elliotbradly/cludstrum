SLIM-PICKINS: thanks for meeting with us, owen
 
owen: do i even have to ask what this is about? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: (sighs) 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: SIMON-BEEING faked the breakdown in court
 i think that was obvious to 
everyone
 it is also more obvious than ever that he is the one who killed 
richard hightower
 
owen: so you say
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: if you are determined to nail a BEEING for this murder, then please go 
after the right one
 
owen: i am
 
SLIM-PICKINS: look, all we are asking for is that nicholas be set free on bail
 
owen: (scoffs) no way
 
SLIM-PICKINS: owen, be reasonable
 
owen: denying an accused murderer bail is reasonable, and judge disanto 
agrees with me
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: we are in a public place
 we are in a restaurant, so would you kindly 
keep your voice down? 
 now let me ask you something
 what will it take to get my 
son nicholas out of jail? 
 
owen: proof
 proof that someone else killed hightower
