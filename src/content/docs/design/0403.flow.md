(Crashworms seek to undermine software integrity,
causing programs to crash or suffer from induced errors.
Besides crashing Programs
and operating systems,
these worms are also sometimes used to intentionally seed bugs into software loaded onto a node.
To accomplish this,
the crashworm must either find a program's source code or crack it using Pilot rating
(see Piracy,
p.
94),

and 'then insert the bug using the rules for Adding Bugs,
p.
119.
Hackers can also load a Erastworm with an already buggy program,

and instruct it to overwrite existing software with the buggy version.

Stealth 'Autosoft: Replicate Cryptoworm Cryptoworms are designed for cryptoviral extortion attacks.
Once they have infiltrated a node,
they either encrypt network communications or stored files,
preventing other users from access- ing them.
While some cryptoworms are used to force the owner into paying for the encryption keys
(so-called "ransomsare"),
hackers also use them to temporarily blind or impede security networks

'Act Two: Pursuit of a Sorcerer.
Following clues to an errant sorcerer,
the characters find him being slowly destroyed by his relic.
The sorcerer is just beginning to realize that he has been duped by his demon,

FEAST OF BLADES od Blades Thus saith the Lord God; an evil,
an only evil,

'The Bund: Zhomshan Road Zhongshan Road,
also known as the Bund
(embankment) by Westerners,
is a wide tree-lined boulevard on the west bank of the Huangpu River that snakes south of the city.
It was the former equivalent to Wall Street or London's City when the Western powers dominated Shanghai.
Practically all of the ld banks,
hotels
and gentlemen's clubs that line the Bund were completely under foreign control.
In 1937,
the Japanese 'overran the eastern coast of China
and occupied Shanghai until the end of World War IT.
Flocks of hostile Japanese Kindred infested a large portion of the city
and scoured the Bund in search of both Western Kindred
and the local Chinese.
To this night,
the Bund remains 2 no-man's-land,
'and nocturnal battles often crash along its rooftops
and down 'its alleys.
The Old Town A mere half-block west from the Bund sits the Old Town,
a collection of neighborhoods bordered by the circular Renmin 'and Zhonghua Roads.
It is the former "Chinese city" oF Shanghai,
the place where the heaviest concentration of Chinese Kindred resides.
Abutting the Bund,
the Old Town was once a rats' alley of slums where few Europeans dared to tread.
Nowadays,
the Old Town is an out-of-the-way place for tourists to witness the vanishing Chinese urban lifestyle: a sort of living,
producing restoration village.
For Kindred,
the Old Town is a closely packed comunity of "Tounies.
" Paranoia
and mistrust reign,

and a code of silence blankets the area.
The streets are narrow
and circuitous,
like 2 great landscape maze; more than one foreign Kindred has been lost wandering around the Jabyrinthine avenues
and been set upon by the Blood Circle,
a roving gang of extremists that patrols the streets of the Old Tonn
and sees the destruction of all foreign Kindred as its goal.
The Blood Circle keeps a sort of order in the Old Town,
but it is a service that no one wants - or has tried to stop.
People's Square

and the Old Town is People's Park
and People's Square,

the floor of the plane is at a severe angle,
water is rushing around 'the vampires' feet

and floating through the area.
All movement speeds are halved in the face of such difficulties,
'and if a character moves more than one or two steps,
the player must roll Dexterity or Strength + Athletics
(difficulty 6) to remain upright.
For the last five rounds of combat,
the water is rushing out of the plane
and into the catacombs,
threatening to sweep the vampires with it.
Each round a character wishes to take an action other 'than holding on for dear life,

doun-crashing the node kills the resonance well in most cases.
They can also,
rarely,
appear temporarily
(a phenomenon known as a resonance flash) or migrate through different nodes Jin repeating cycles
(resonance undulations).
Due to their positive effects on Resonance abilities,
resonance wells are sought out by technomancers,
guilds,

and free sprites alike,

and are heavily contested
(comparable to power sites
and mana nexi in the Awakened world).
In game terms,
a resonance well has a rating that represents 'its power.
This rating acts as a positive dice pool modifier for all tests that involve Resonance,
whether made by a technomancer or sprite: Fading Tests,
Compiling
and Registering Tests,
uses of 'complex forms,

and so on.
Dissonant technomancers
(see p.
175) suffer the opposite effect of regular technomancers when they encounter a resonance well: they suffer a negative dice pool modifier equal to the well?s rating.
Dissonance variants of resonance wells,
called dissonance pools,
also exist.
These pools have the same impairing effects on 'technomancers as resonance wells have on dissonants.
Resonance Rifts 'A few resonance wells are known to inexplicably act as gate- ways to the resonance realms
(usually a specific resonance realm),
'transporting unwary users against their will.
These rifts are uncom mon,
tend to occur without warning,

and do not last for long.
If stable rifts exist,
they are not talked about openly,

and are Likely cherished
and protected.
Such rifts provide an open passage for non-submerged 'technomancers to access the resonance realms,
even allowing the travellers to bypass the Event Horizon
(see p.
174).
In fact,
rifts may pull in unwary or unwilling Matrix denizens who have 'the misfortune of coming across one-a successful Willpower + Charisma
(3) Test is necessary to avoid being sucked in.
While most resonance wells are invisible to non-tech- nomancers,
resonance rifts tend to
(but not always) take more visible forms,
usually demarked with iconography such as swirling vortices,
tornadoes of data,
or ugly pixelation
and de-rezzed stains bleeding across a system's sculpted environment.
RESONANCE REALMS There is a certain feeling that every technomancer knows when diving through the Matrix.
It's more than the constant buzz of data traffic in the background,
it's the feeling that there

lieb's not always found on the edges of known Formatted Space,
though.
Sometimes you find it tucked between two sectors that have been around forever.
No one knows if these spots have just been overlooked or if they just pop up in random Jocations.
Sone say Turing's computer is still out there,
spinning new strands of the Web.
I think the Virgin stuff 'appears as more Sleepers use computers.
As more information flows into the Web,
the Web grows to make room.
For those of you without visuals: Virgin Web looks like ghostly angel-hair spaghetti,
or like cobwebs of shimering Light.
Unlike the strong strands of energy binding sectors 'together,
these bits of floating Web look more like clouds than Like patterns.
Once a sector or conduit is formatted,
this cloud 'takes shape,
first as a glistening spiderweb,
then as a matrix pattern
(like a 3-D graphic skeleton),
then into a more-or-less solid representation of the formatted subject.
All the "clouds" in the area flow into a kind of energy vortex when a sector is formatted; by the end of the program,
the Virgin Web has had its cherry burst.
Those fuzzy clouds are gone for good.
Restricted Sectors are protected.
Theoretically,
those Jocks keep random or unauthorized users out.
Typical Re~ stricted Sectors include Virtual Adept Chantries,
military
and 'financial systems,

and anything the Technocracy builds.
These Places are guarded by everything from dumb password pro- grams to Paradox spirits.
Most include enough layers of blinds,
dummies
and traps to confuse the most diehard hacker.
You can fight your way in â if you don't mind everyone inside hearing you coming â but the best spinners sneak in unno- 'ticed or set up a back door.
The processor drain required to 'move through the constant verification routines makes every- 'thing slower,
but everyone who's *supposed* to be in the sector has the same problem.
Oh,

and be careful about picking a fight in a Restricted Sector; getting dumped from one hurts more than getting dumped fron a Free Sector.
A lot more.
'As I mentioned,
a sector takes the clouds of Web
and spins 'em into the desired shape.
Most sectors are manmoth geonetric shapes connected to "wires" or "spiderwebs" of conduit lines.
For the most part,
spinners 'port from sector 'to sector,
or travel through conduits.
It takes spice
and a combination of Correspondence
and Spirit knowledge to get outside a sector
and look at it from the long view.
On the inside,
sectors look like whatever the makers want.
Most are pretty abstract,
brimming with fractals,
colors,
grids
and whatever else.
Some get pretty ornate â Victorian mansions,
endless deserts with living cacti,
swirl- ing fractal storms,
that sort of thing â
and seem to go on forever in all directions.
Concepts like space
and time vary fron sector to sector,

and don't really relate to the space outside very much; the Grid Sector for the World Bank Exchange is titanic on the inside,
but takes up very little "space" when seen from the area between sectors.
Depending on the traffic inside the sector
and the protections on it,
the outside "surface" shimmers with living Light.
A high-density Website glows like a neon sign,
sur- rounded by the Christmas tree bulbs of a million individual sites.
Most times,
you can tell a Restricted Sector from a free fone by the color of the surface
(not to mention the guards,
wards or warning signs on the conduits leading to it).
Most free sectors glow with friendly "cool" colors â green,
blue,
etc.
â while restricted ones often feature warning colors like yellow or bright red.
Total shutdown sites
(those with the 'tightest security) tend to shimmer with faint black
and silver Light,
but some glow like living ice,
just *waiting* for some- one to try to fuck with their countermeasures.


Clanbook: Setite oth,
st veral 56 Loyalty lies at the heart of the Assamite clan.
In undeath 'they remain disgustingly loyal to the gods they worshipped in life,
whether this was Jehovah or Marduk.
They equally prize loyalty to their Antediluvian.
Assamites love to prove their courage,
devotion
and honor by stepping into other people's business
and picking a fight.
Distressingly,
their theology made a sacrament out of diablerizing other vampires.
As you may have heard,
the Tremere once cursed the Assamite clan so that 'the vitae of other vampires would be poison unto them.
That curse recently ended
(I know not how); instead the Assamites now suffer from a mad thirst for the blood of other vampires.
I very much hope that the Tremere can reinstate their curse,
which now looks more like a blessing.
I urge you to stay away from Assamites.
Their current wave of bloodlust drives them erratically
and uncontrollably.
I hear 'that some Assamites find comfort
and renewed self-discipline 'through Great Set.
I also hear that numerous Followers of Set fed the mad thirst of Assamites whom they sought to prosely- 'tize.
In their current state,
you cannot seduce or manipulate an Assamite with any certainty.
Ventrue 'I regard the Ventrue as the most despicable of the Twelve 'Clans ~
and the greatest success of the Aeons.
What else would 'you expect from the clan founded by Atum-Ra himself? The Ventrue are the Demiurge's trusties in this prison of a world,
'thinking themselves the masters because they elevate themselves a little bit above the other prisoners.
Ra placed the Ventrue under 'the sign of Capricorn the Goat,

and the self-proclaimed "Clan of Kings" are Judas goats leading vampires
and mortals alike to 'the Aeons? pens
and abattoirs.
Plague take then! Their pride,
however,
provides the key to a Ventrue's seduction,
destruction
and
(perhaps) eventual liberation.
'They feel the tug of ambition as strongly as the Lasonbra,
but many of them also feel they must cloak their ambition in a facade of duty,
respectability,
even martyrdom.
Ventrue,
like all vampires,
retain undignified appetites from life.
Help a Ventrue to indulge himself in secret
(and his 'shameful? desires may astound you with their harmlessness rather than 'their perversity),

and he is yours.
If you can resist a Ventrue's command of the wills of others â in which arts,
I warn,
they have no equal â you may easily buy some favors,
extort oth- 'ers through threats of ruining his precious reputation,

and

power within the corporation,
all of them,
like him,
are serpents.

More humanocentric folks wonder if this was like the world the earliest humans encountered,

during the epic clash.
However,
the force the K?Kree fielded was impressive enough.
Lucan made 2 final hour- 'long oration to the crews of 'his? fleet before the battle,
'then callously vented the fuel tanks of all the ships he controlled.
Nobody would Jump out of this battle.
The only hope for survival was to fight
and win.
It was a masterstroke; one that ensured nearly 100% casualties 'among Lucan's forces,
but one that won the battle.
What Little is known about the fight comes from the few survivors.
Avery was among them,
purely because his flagship retained the capability to Jump
and was able to escape when surrounded
and crippled.
Others in the same situation could only fire back until they were destroyed,
selling their lives as dearly as they could.
Lucan's fleet fought as a superbly coordinated unit,
'its every volley
and maneuver coordinated by 2 naval genius that unflinchingly sacrificed vessels to achieve 'an advantage elsewhere in the combat.
And while the space battle raged,
Lucan was attempting to infect the 'enemy ships
and even the Gateway Station computers 'themselves.
Anv!ull?1xux
and Lucan grappled electronically 'as their ships pounded on one another with guns
and missiles.
Several times Lucan directed ships under his command to erash themselves into the station,
using their mass to destroy key defense sites or other important targets.
His vessels fired into the station,
ignoring the enemy ships that attacked them.
They were destroyed,
but the defenses of Gateway Station were gradually written down.
Only 2 madman would throw away lives so callously,
'and only a naval genius could have coordinated it.
But the last of the Lucan Ships was both,

and as the defenses of the station crumbled,
this was his moment.
Some say 'that the mad Emperor won his redemption in the Second Battle of Gateway,
but the truth is that Lucan did not lead the fleet to victory as recompense for his earlier actions,
he did it because he was an evil megalomaniac who could not abide the thought that someone else might take his place.
He did it to eliminate his rival,
Anviull?1lxux,
not to redeem himself in the eyes of history.
But whatever the reason,
this was Lucan's hour.
His flagship dived into the thick of the enemy,
attracting the fire of every enemy ship in range
and thereby clearing a path for the biggest of the ships he comanded,
the Superdreadnought flagship of the ghost fleet,
which then ramed itself into Gateway Station at extremely high velocity.
'Accounts of the next few minutes are very confused.
Apparently the K*Kree ships lost all cohesion for a time

River Travel A raft
(the primary form of water travel on the plateau) has 1-3 ship hit points
(SHP).
To build a raft takes 4 to 12 hours; each 4 hours equals 1 SHP.
In addition,
30Â° of rope are required for each SHP; a 3 SHP raft will quickly fall apart without 90Â° of rope.
If a monster attacks,
each 10 points of danage to the vessel equals 1 SHP.
Each time the raft loses 1 or more SHP,
everyone aboard must make a Dexterity check or fall into the water.
When the raft reaches @ SHP,
it falls apart,

and everyone goes into the water.

Still,
Muslim Stargazers added a few texts to the Corpus Hermeticum.
The Thrice-Great achieved a few small revivals in this period,
'though.
Most notably,
Legacy members gathered at the court of Uligh Begh,
in 15th-century Samarkand.
Astronomy fascinated 'this grandson of the conqueror Timur.
His observatory compiled 'the most accurate star tables
and calculations of planetary mo- tion the world had yet seen.
Under cover of this research,
the Thrice-Great restored contact with many powerful spirits of the planets.
The mages who currently occupy the Legacy's hidden sanctum,
however,
are not Thrice-Great
and refuse to let modern Hermetics search for lost secrets of their forebears.
Meanuhile,
the Thrice-Great Legacy filtered back into Europe along with the rest of Classical learning.
By the 15th century,
European mages actively sought to reclaim the secrets of Greek
and Roman willworkers.
Sleepers also rediscovered 'the Corpus Hermeticum,
much to the Guardians of the Veil?s collective annoyance.
'The sheer diversity of magical doctrines now available to 'contemporary mages also erodes the Thrice-Great's claims to ancient authority.
The Hermetics certainly wield great power,
but not enough to render them clearly superior to other Legacies.
The Hermetics? methods are also undeniably cumbersome.
The Legacy enjoyed a surge in recruitment during the 1960s,
when interest in astrology made newly Awakened mages receptive to the Thrice-Great's claims of ancient wisdom.
Recruitment dropped off again,
however,

and the Legacy is clearly in decline.
After 2,
000 years of reaching for the sky,
will the Thrice-Great finally erash to Earth?

But the leader called of his men and,

When their rescuers removed their outer furs in their cave home,
Jeanette was taken aback to find they were examples of 2 people long thought extinct.
Gradually she came to appreciate the Bison People 'and learned their language.
Her superior educa~ tion enabled her to make herself very useful to the tribe,
particularly when she began using powdered gemstones to augment the pigments for the tribe?s 'ceremonial cave paintings.
Originally she agreed to marry Tarlan to gain more protection for the children
and consolidate her new position as sha- maness; as time went by,
she grew to love her hus- band
and share his goals of improving the tribe's fortunes.
Today,
Jeanette is less concerned about the Bolsheviks
and more concerned about the increas~ Jing aggression of the Forest People.
She's also wor- ried about finding suitable spouses for her children.
She would like to see them return to the world beyond the plateau,

Visitors from Other Worlds It's a feature of freewheeling fantasy worlds that they want methods of drafting monsters,
heroes,

and visitors from other worlds.
The Empire offers several obvious entry points for creatures from other worlds,
if that's your GM pleasure.
Flying realms: Lands dropping out of the sky can come from any sky,
not just the other side of the horizon.
Most flying realms are connected to this world,
but the masters of the High Arcane generally agree that lands cut free from their connection to the ground become somewhat more likely to fly free of the world they originally belonged to.
Dungeons rising: Dungeons rising from below the world bombard the surface with a steady stream of bizarre entities
and fiendish creations.
Many of them claim to have originated on other worlds.
Portals
and similar transports: Have no shame about using portals to other worlds.
It's a staple because it works.
Just remember to ask who or what,
if anything,
is responsible for the opening,

and for everyone's sake,
try to make your portals unique: "Just like every portal you've seen in the movies,

and he's not afraid of anybody.
He saw something strange the other day: a mountain unfolded,
as though it were made of paper,

and something flew out
(it also seemed to be made of paper).
Zhanghuai wrote this all down on a piece of bark,
because he thought that he was gaing to die,

and he wanted others to know what he had seen.
21-K Jagged chunks of twisted shrapnel are strewn amid deep furrows in the earth.
These lead to the crash site at 22-K.

in 1350,
the death toll was horrendous in major towns,
such as London.
Many bodies were thrown into mass graves,
which later became London's public parks,
as nobody was willing to erect housing on them.
Few know or would care to know,
these days,
what lies beneath the grass of Hyde Park,
Green Park
and others.
One of the mass graves beneath Hyde Park became a Tether to Makatiel,
the Prince of Disease,

and had a 'Seneschal appointed to guard it.
Unfortunately,
Makatiel himself was destroyed the following year,
as the result of @ combined operation by Dominic

It's as if some of them had partially dissolved.
Many are in strange corners,
like they were dragged there.
Thus bodies may be missed at first or found in places that suggest they were put there for some reason.
'A couple of the bodies are suited,

and armed
(with weapons ranging from steak knives to snub pistols).
They seem to have died of suit breach.

'The ship has three decks.
The upper one is crew quarters
and ship systems,

(with the exception that the engineering rooms drop right through all 3 decks,
the next is passenger accommodation,

and the bottom deck is a large cargo hold for most of its length.
'Searching one section of each deck will take one sequence.
Entry to the Derelict It is possible to gain entry to the derelict through the dorsal maintenance airlock
(which opens into a corridor in the crew area) or the ship's launch docking area
(the launch is of course gone).
This 'opens into the aft end of the crew quarters,
at a shaft that allows access to the passenger deck but not the holds.
'Access via the passenger airlocks is somewhat easier.
These are situated port
and starboard,
just behind the observation area.
They 'are wider than usual,
to allow for luggage
and such like.
Conditions Inside the Derelict Artificial gravity is still operating aboard the wreck,
though at 1/5 of a g.
This is low enough that movement is an awkward combination of zero-g procedures
and normal walking.
Note that although objects possess only 1/10 of their normal weight,
they still have mass
and inertia.
It is just as hard to get something moving aboard the wreck as on Earth,

and once moving it will not stop until it hits something or eventually falls to the deck.
Since the ship is bobbing about,
objects will rash around from time to time,
presenting a real hazard of being crushed.
Combat aboard the derelict will be extremely awkward.
Treat as low-g combat,

and increase all hit rolls by the penalty given on the weather conditions chart above.
The only light in most areas is dim red emergency lighting.
Characters? lamps are sufficient,
but the combination of bright beams,
dim areas
and loose objects sliding around
(and hanging in the air for long periods) creates a tense environment characterized by sudden movements seen in peripheral vision,
familiar objects mis-identified in torchlight,

and obvious things overlooked.
In this eerie environment,
even characters expecting to find corpses may be shocked.
Moving Between Sections 'The various sections of the ship
(detailed below) are separated by heavy bulkheads
(some of which have buckled alarmingly!).
Bulkheads are penetrated by iris valves,
most of which are not sealed shut.
Lack of power means that they must be cranked open manually,
requiring an entire sequence.
Once open,
characters can move about freely.
Within a section,
rooms have light doors which can easily be forced open.
Movement is simple enough.
Searching an area takes 'an entire sequence
(and this is a quick search.
A detailed combing of a single room can be accomplished in a sequence,
but there are several rooms in each area).
If characters just move straight 'through,
they may still spot obvious things.
Moving through a section 'takes negligible time,
unless the characters want to keep running the

Tunnel Under the River This tunnel descends as one goes toward the north,
with the air becoming cooler
(or warmer if moving south).
At the point where the 'tunnel is unter the river,
there are numerous gems
(worth 10g each) embedded in the ceiling,
with water trickling ever so slightly from their edges.
If one of these is pried free,

The ceiling is 10Â° high at the top of the stairs on either end of the cavern,

The surface is so slippery that if a character attempts to move at more 'than half their normal movement rate,
they must save versus paralysis or fall down.
A fall down the stairs causes dÃ© damage.

surface of the "cavern" contain the heat of the lava so one could walk right up to the edge of the flow without being harmed.

'Another common method of compressing time is showing a series of conflicts that are important as obstacles,
but the details aren't vital to the story.
If there are a lot of conflicts that you want to play through quickly,
you can boil them down to one contested roll of each player character's appropriate pool against 'an appropriate number of dice for a typical opponent.
For example,
in the situation where various characters are trying to get information on the street,
the roll might be Manipulation + Streetwise against a rough average of the informant's Resolve + Composure
(say,
2 or 3 dice).
The martial arts tournament might be a Stamina + Brawl roll
(since being able to do lots of fights in a row is more important than being particularly strong or fast Jin an individual battle) versus the average opponent's Stamina + Brawl.
You can read the dice roll as normal to get a sense of how well the character does in the conflict.
Further,
you can rule 'that each success a player gets allows that person to provide one scene in the montage,
while each success in the Storyteller's roll allows you to dictate a scene.
Finally,
a frequent use of a montage is when a character is 'earning an important skill during the course of a story.
This is just like a time-lapse montage,
except that Storytellers can use this as a justification to allow players to spend experience points during a chapter,
instead of between chapters.
Some common examples are shooting a variety of targets at a firing range
(Firearms),
sparring against a variety of opponents
(Brawl) or trying out a new power in a number of situations
(Disciplines).

'The Vampire Eleodra Malfador is very,
very,
very old.
After she barely escaped her last great battle against heroic adventurers,
she decided to leave evil plots
and Machiavellian schemes against her fellow undead behind,

and retire to a quiet corner of the Dragon Empire.
She spent the past several years in a small cliffside tower 'on the coast of the Midland Sea,
reading books,
viewing the stars,
writing an extensive treatise on astronomy,

and draining the occasional villager.
But the world will not allow Eleodra Malfador to live in peace.
Centuries ago,
she was an eyewitness at a great event,
the details of which are now lost to history.
Now,
one of the icons needs that knowledge.
The Icons Before the game begins,
have the players make their icon relationship rolls.
Write down which icon rolls had results of a 5 or a 6.
Choose one icon from these positive results to be the group's patron for this adventure.
Through an NPC contact,
this is the icon who sends the PCs on their mission.
Optionally,
you can ignore the rolls
and choose an icon that one or more PCs has a relationship with to be the patron.
If you
and your players enjoy intrigue,
you could also decide that multiple icons are involved,
each with their own-perhaps conflicting-agendas.
This type of scenario usually results in the PCs working against each other,
or working together to figure out how to complete the mission in a way that satisfies all the icons
(or none of them).
We've provided write-ups for several icons who might want 'to know what Eleodra knows.
Each write-up includes suggested NPC representatives of that icon,
what the icon wants from Eleodra,

and what the NPC gave the PCs to offer her as payment.
These adventure seeds help get the players invested in this mission,

and provide the GM with a storyline that could continue beyond this adventure.

On the downside,
the fungus is hyper-caloric 'and anyone getting the benefits will also gain a massive amount of weight
and lose 1 DEX
and 1 CON point in the next d12 hours.
The fungus will infect the system so that such weight gain is permanent; diet
and exercise will not help.
A Cure Disease spell will kill the fungus
and cure any afflicted individual,
restoring their DEX
and CON if they engage in 2d4 weeks of rigorous exercise,
but the character also imediately loses their permanent extra hit point as well as the hit points originally healed by feasting on the fungus.

and the tower falls,

and those that inhabited it Erash to earth.
Pride built the tower,
not desire for enlightenment,

and when this card appears in 2 read- ing,
one must be careful that the lust for acknowledgment land accolades for an endeavor does not eclipse the more poignant reasons for it.
The most obvious source for the Tower is,
of course,
the Tower of Babel from Judeo-Christian mythology.
Men tried to build a structure so tall it would reach Heaven,

and God struck 'them down for their insolence.
But it does beg the question â did they actually have a chance of reaching Heaven? If not,
why would God have cared enough not only to destroy the tower but also inflict the curse of languages on mankind,
forcing them for- ever into division? Mages look at the Tower as the perfect metaphor for their own Fall; the destruction of the Celestial Ladder
and of the Awak- ened City.
The parallels to Babel fare present here,
too,
although in this case the Ladder could,
in fact,
reach "Heaven,
"
and it wasn't de- stroyed by an omnipotent being,
but rather the ascended masters 4in the Supernal Realms.
What does all of this mean to 'the mage on the journey of the

Web resembles the Earth before God or whatever brought it nto its final form.
More humanocentric folks wonder if this was like the world the earliest humans encountered,
a place of unformed possibilities
and fluid laws.
I've heard a few theories claim that the Web is a semi-sentient creature or a spirit entity,
a god that's only beginning to wake up.
What feeds it? That's a tricky question.
Based on the incredible spread of the Net,
its semi-electrical nature
and its undeniable mystick essence,
the reigning theory specu- ates that the Web consumes Quintessence energy from computer users.
The more effort
and time people put into computer-based work,
the more the Net grows.
The more it grows,
the more it consumes.
Computer users feel the burn 4in the form of headaches,
backaches,
carpal tunnel syn- drone
and a dozen other aliments that hardly existed before 'the Information Age.
Can the Net sustain itself without that daily input from Hamburger Country? That,
my friends,
is a very troubling question.
We don"t know yet.
'Â® Even though the Web is theoretically infinite,
Unformatted Web is hard to find.
In a place that sees *mil- Lions* of users a day,
Virgin Web is rarer than a virgin hooker.

You can re-format them,
but the new design isn't as clean as a format on Virgin Web.
The first imprint is always the strongest,

and elements of it always pop up through whatever anyone puts on top.
It's kinda like recording a new movie on top of an old one.
The video tape's a little worn,
so the picture's not as sharp,

and if you look closely,
you can sometimes see ghost images of the first movie 4in the background.
Now,
I'm not sayin' that re-formatting an erased sector ain't valuable.
It's just that finding pure,

Formatted Web,
Sectors
and Conduits Formatted Web is where we spend 99.
9% of our time on the far side of Hamburger Country.
There are two major types of Formatted Web: sectors
and conduits.
Sectors are the places inside the Web,

and conduits are the pathways be- 'tween them.
Sone say sectors are just places where conduits collide
and make an open space.
Either way,
sectors are where the action is.
When you format Virgin Web,
it becomes a sector,

and it spawns conduits that connect it to other sectors.
Sectors sometimes spawn conduits to unexpected places,

and some Adepts like to build conduits between sectors that have no business being connected.
Sectors are all classified as either Free or Restricted.
Free Sectors are where information travels freely; you don't need @ password
and there's no security.
You find 'em all

the stupid fucks blew themselves sky-high.

Big lesson,
kiddies: Doors swing both ways.
The Crash wrecked a lot of work.

most of Netspace looks like a war zone.
You might hear some people say the Crash was a good thing 'cause it cleared out 2 lot of deadweight,

researches the behaviour of metahunans when they are confronted with massive disasters
and apocalyptic scenarios.
To achieve realistic results,
test subjects are kidnapped or lured in under the pretext of other projects

After the test series,
the subjects are administered a chemical cocktail that erases their memories of the experiments
and released.
Flesh Trade This illegal node,
rumoured to be operated by a consortium of Triad groups,

Part brothel
and part sex party,
the Trade also offers an assortment of BTL feeds,

and for a premium sells customized experienc- es,
where you can bring any sort of deviant fantasy to life.
Aside from the desire to hook their customers on BTL,

It is unclear how resonance wells are created,

and no technomancer has yet found a way to Diving into the Depths Only technomancers who have undergone submersion
(p.

Non-technomancers may only access the resonance realms via 'a resonance rift

Oh the Insanity We?ve kept our core setting somewhat sane so that individual campaigns can spiral into madness.
Depending on your predilections,
the 13th Age could be the age where one or more of 'the icons lose their freaking minds.
The Blue might be so wracked by magic that it's no longer sane in any language.
The Diabolist might establish a secret cult whose members go progressively insane

and cannibalism.

Specifically,
it's part of the Dracula Dossier series,
an epic improvisational campaign that pits the player characters against the original vampire,
Count Dracula.
You don't need a copy of the Dracula Dossier: Director's Handbook or Dracula Unredacted to run this adventure; you do,
however,
need the Nights Black Agents rules.
Like that campaign,
The Van Helsing Letter is an improvised mission.
Instead of a series of scenes linked by clues,
most of this mission consists of write-ups of NPCs,
locations
and items,
coupled with advice 'on how to link them together
and how to pace the game.
The players drive the investigation.
In 'the opening scene,
they acquire a century- old letter from Abraham Van Helsing.
They can follow the clues in that handout in any order.

or
(a thought they barely dare entertain) even Fall.
Druiel lives in an apartment on the west side of town.
His cover story is that his father is a traveling salesman who leaves him alone a lot.
In addition to everything else,
Dituiel is the weakest link in the Austin clique's chain.
He*s running more than a few plots behind his friends? backs,

and while he'd never consciously betray them,
he's certainly close to reaping armloads of dissonance.
As a 'Seraph,

and unwilling to lie,
the clique has elected him 'the best angel to continue pulling the wool over the Old Guy's
(p.
99) eyes - after all,
the ancient Malakite would never suspect a Seraph of misleading him.
Of course,
Druiel is starting to feel a bond with the old angel,

and visits him whenever he can.
Similarly,
he's consorting with some dark,
dark demons - like the Diabolical who lives in the catacombs beneath the city
(p.

(see p.
91).

(Ironically,
she's planning to use the uranium to destroy the catacombs.
) Mitrah lets him use her ancient Tether,
Enchanted Rock,
as his killing grounds since it's far enough out of town that most of the celestials won?t hear the disturbances he cre- ates in the Symphony while he dirties his hands.


In Play: PIT
and Spikes To perform a PIT,
a pursuing character must have caught up to the target vehicle
(see "Vehicle Pursuit,
" p.
69 of the World of Darkness Rule- book).
The two drivers make opposed Dexterity + Drive rolls.
If one vehicle is smaller,
it suffers 'a penalty to this roll equal to half the difference of the two vehicles' Sizes,
rounded down.
If the pursuer loses the roll,
he misses or falters
and 'the pursuit continues,
with the quarry gaining the number of successes by wh:,
ch he won the roll.
'If the pursuer wins the roll,
the quarry's vehicle suffers a damage roll equal to 1 + the number of net successes the pursuer received.
In addition,
'the quarry must make a second Dexterity + Drive roll,
suffering a penalty equal to the nunber of successes by which the pursuer won the roll to PIT.
If the quarry fails this second roll,
he spins 'out
and comes to a halt.
In any of these cases
and on any of these rolls,
a dramatic failure results in a crash.
If a vehicle strikes a spike strip,
each tire suf- fers a separate five-die damage roll with the Armor Piercing 1 effect
(thus,
a normal tire?s Durability of 1 does not protect against this damage).
A spike strip has Durability 3,
Size 2
and Structure 5,
but does not suffer damage from being run over.


'The Curious Structures of Mr.
Guilford One of the mit curious of Chicago's architects was a 'man named Andrew Guilford.
Throughout most of the 1920s,
Guilford was an inexplicably fashionable architect for a cer- 'tain subset of Chicago's landed gentry.
His homes,
while beau- 'tiful
and unusually sturdy,
weren't particularly original,

and certainly didn't seem so at the time Guilford was designing,
in the wake of the much-better-known Frank Lloyd Wright.
'The appeal of Guilford's designs,
it has been surmised,
stems from the fact that they were unusual without being too radi- cal,
just different enough to appeal to Chicago's burgeoning bourgeoisie.
The key feature shared by all of his later build- ings were strange
(and technically illegal) secret rooms; each Guilford design had a hidden room that,
in one way or an- other,
captured the essence of the rest of the house.
One enthusiastic critic praised the secret rooms as being "the ar- chitectural equivalents of FabergÃ© eggs.
" Historians have been arguing for decades now what the intended purpose of these rooms was.
Sone historians have suggested that they were rooms for illegal distilleries,
private hone speakeasies.
These extra chambers are often surprisingly spacious
and extraor- dinarily secure; nearly all are located under the building's foundation
and lack windows.
Many of these buildings were later destroyed,
either 'through the usual churning of construction through Chi- cago neighborhoods or through the more direct hand of the government that alleged
(in more than one account) that Guilford houses were often owned by "bootleggers,
commu- nists,
atheists
and other persons of questionable character.
" Prohibition,
including all the misery came with it,
was only the first of several blows to the city from which it never fully recovered.
The second of those blows came in October of 1929 with the crash of the stock market,
which ushered in 'the worst economic disaster America has ever seen.
'The Great Depression 'The Depression hit Chicago hard.
Since the Great Fire,
'the city had fancied its progress immune to the setbacks that plagued other,
lesser cities,
but Chicago quickly learned oth-

For their two other Relationship Dice,
the players can pick another good Icon,
double up on their shared patron,
or pick another Icon altogether.
Hostile Icons These Icons are generally enemies of the Empire.
The one picked by the majority of the players is going to be the villain of the adventure.
+ The Diabolist plays with fire,
summoning demons that even 'the Archmage fears.
She can be cruel or charming,
benign or utterly destructive depending on her mood.
She claims that her vast
and ever-growing army of fiends poses no real threat to the Empire,

and that her summoning such hordes actually takes pressure off the Great Gold Wyrm,
but who can trust the word of the mistress of chaos? + Once,
the Lich King was the great Wizard King,
until he grew corrupt
and was slain in a revolt led by the first Emperor.
He rose again as a Lich,

and gathered all undead to his banner.
The Lich King still considers himself the rightful ruler,

and has even helped protect the land against outside threats in the past,
but he never relents in his desire to see all the citizens of the Empire,
living
and dead,
bow to his dark throne.
+ The return of the Orc Lord to the Empire heralds a new era of strife
and carnage.
This charismatic warlord welded hundreds of warring orc tribes into a vast army,

and soon they will rash into the Imperial Legions like a tidal wave of battle- axes
and spears.
+ The Three are three of the oldest
and most dangerous dragons - the sinister Black,
the sorcerous Blue,

and the apocalyptic Red - who have allied together.
weirdly,
the Blue rules the Imperial city of Drakenhall - she knelt before the Emperor,

and submitted to a geas placed on her by the Archmage.
Doubtless it's all part of some sinister scheme,
but for the moment at least,
one of the Three isn't actively trying to destroy the Empire.
That's more than can be said for the other two - the Black sends assassins
and killer monks to sow chaos,
while the Red sometimes appears to sear cities
and legions to ash.
The remaining Icons won't play a part in this adventure - unless a player character has a relationship with one of them,

and brings 'them in somehow! + The Crusader is the merciless fist of the dark gods,
channeling the powers of darkness to battle monsters
and demons.
He's not the champion the Emperor wants,
but he may be the champion the Empire needs.
+ The Dwarf Lord is the Emperor's stalwart ally - but he's got a list of enemies as long as his beard,
which can cause problems both above
and below ground.
Right now,
though,
'the Emperor needs dwarven warriors to hold back the Orc Lord's armies.
+ The Elf Queen rules the three branches of Elvendom - High Elves,
Wood Elves
and Dark Elves.
She embodies the qualities of all three.
Her alliance with the Emperor
and truce with the Dwarf King ensures she keeps her Dark Elf ambition in check,
but her Wood Elf wildness
and High Elf arcane power make for a dangerous combination.

Temple of the Sun Cabal is designed for four to six Sth level player characters.
In search of a missing vampire,
the PCs are led to 'a volcanic island in the Midland Sea occupied by fanatical sun cultists.
The cultists plan to sacrifice the vampire in a ritual to summon
and control a long-lost flying temple to the sun gods,

and use its power to "purify" the Dragon Empire by exterminating all other religions.
Can the players prevent the dawn of a terrifying new age,
ruled by a ruthless theocracy of fire? You'1l find a full write-up of Sunlit-which is now a flying dungeon variously known as the Wild Garden,
the Ziggurat,

and the Abominationâin 13 True Ways.
You can use this adventure to bring the dungeon into your campaign as a location to be explored; or if that doesn't appeal to you,
feel free to have it explode spectacularly or ERaSH into the Midland Sea after it's finished serving its purpose as a momentary threat to the world.
Assumptions: This adventure assumes that the PCs have already formed a group
and are open to missions from the icons.
If not,
you may need to introduce additional scenes to get them started.
Time: You should be able to complete this adventure in a single session of roughly four hours.
Adjustments: If you're playing with only three PCs,
you?11 want to make the battles slightly easier.
Bumping the group all the way to seven PCs means that you should add a bit more than another PC's worth of monsters; you'd probably be fine making the battles as tough as they would need to be for eight PCs because of the high number of synergies in a seven-character adventuring group.
Using icon relationship advantages: The Icons sections attached to each scene mention ways that player characters could use specific icon relationship advantages to help them against the temple's defenders
and defenses.
Our suggestions cover what might be accomplished with a 6 result.
If the PC uses a 5,
the player or the GM needs to make the results a bit more interesting than outright success or nullification of a monster ability.
Rather than further complicate a combat scene with a strange consequence from what was intended to be an advantage,
we recommend saving the complications

T HEH OOKAH OF AIN When that unnamed addict brought the Hookah of Pain back from Mexico,
the large com 'munal pipe seemed perfect for his group.
But while it was a really cool hookah,
it was also a celestial artifact,
a very special kind of reliquary.
It has six tubes coming off of it,
meaning six people can use it at a tine.
When taking a hit off the hookah,
the memory of the person?s most recent moment of pain leaves the user?s mind
and enters 'the pipe.
Later,
the first time the target tries to recall the pain,
make a Precision roll.
If the roll isn't made,
then the memory is gone forever,

and 2 point of dark
and painful Essence is generated in 'the bowl of the pipe.
Unlike a normal,
small reli- quary,
the Hookah of Pain can store 36 points of Essence.
The hookah can only be used voluntari- ly.
After a number of uses equal to the user?s Soul points,
he permanently loses 1 point of a random characteristic.
Since all the users were ordinary humans,
they hhad no way to use the Essence that the reliquary began to stockpile.
It overflowed rapidly,

and the backlash of released pain killed everyone in the room.
The small supernova of negativity created an infernal Tether,
claimed
and maintained by Fleurity.
Tts current Seneschal is Mackie.
He has a 'small group of about 49 people who are regular contributors to the hookah's Essence reservoir,

and who are rapidly losing memory of most of 'their lives.

Because each instruction that is passed from one computer to another is distilled into a code which is already spoken by the next computer in the line,
the time taken to carry instructions from one segment to another is reduced to a minim.
The fact that each such message passed through a crewmember can be suthenticated by an independent electronic verifier virtu- Blly eliminates the chance of massive internal viral infesta- tion.

Fuchi security managers ran around 'ike headless chickens trying to prepare contingency plans,
but there was greater chaos in store.
The same will gave Villiers Fuchi shares amounting to control of another tuo percent of 'the company.
The very same day,
Fuchi's talented director of internal security turned in his letter of resignation,
opting instead for the cushy life of a Renraku executive.
The close friendship that 160 Richard villiers& Miles lanier 'plumet),
resign from Renraku,

and turn himself over to Fuchi internal security.
The decision,
which bought Fuchi some time 'against Renraku but left the battle lines within the corporation more clearly drawn than ever,
caused many of the participants to blink in confusion,
but not Villiers
and Lanier.
OF course,
as we now know,
the entire thing was possibly the greatest long con perpetrated in the entire 21st century,
orchestrated by Villiers 'and Lanier working together to weaken Fuchi
and Renraku
and fund the birth of Novatech.
In September 2059,
on White Monday during the Tokyo stock market rash,
Richard Villiers finished his masterstroke.
He formed Novatech Incorporated after dumping his Fuchi shares,
sold the first half to make the stock price plumet,
then he let go of the remaining half after Nakatomi
and Yamana raised the price with a bidding war.
> What Mr.
Bonds is leaving out is that it was Villiers who orchestrated the White Monday Erash in the first place.
> Plan 9 > A "fact" most Likely omitted due to the complete lack of any kind of support- Jing evidence.
> Snopes The final twist of the knife was that Villiers had regained control of JRJ International
and hence gained control of Fuchi*s seat on the Corporate Court,
as well as the justice who controlled it
(who was a Villiers loyalist).
The remainder of Fuchi fell apart,
with Yanana
and Nakatomi fighting each other tooth
and claw over what was left.
The remants of the company eventually fell to Renraku
and Shiawase to pick over.
In a single brilliant move,
Villiers had weakened Renraku significantly 'and destroyed Fuchi.
His first action after forming Novatech was to bring Lanier on board as his head of security,
letting the entire world in on the deception.
The tactic of sabotaging your 'own position/organization while secretly building something stronger
and better became known as the Villiers Maneuver.

right? People don't crush corporations-corporations crush people.
Villiers,
with Lanier as his more- 'than-able accomplice,
is the exception,
proving the rule or not.
> Baka Dabora The newly formed Novatech was lean
and mean,
but its initial success was short lived.
Even with the billions he'd made from deft stock transactions,
Villiers had borrowed 2 'lot of money to execute the last phase of his plan,

and he was under attack from multiple quarters as the other megas reacted to the newest threat.
One unusual angle of attack was Art Dankwalther,
a former Fuchi employee who blamed Villiers for the destruction of the corporation
and of his life.
Dankwalther intentionally styled himself as Villiers? arch-nemesis.
With all of his assets under attack,
Villiers was forced to take Novatech

The Enemy Archaeological evidence suppressed by Aegis Kai Doru,
dating from before the official dawn of civiliza- 'tion,
suggests that vampires have walked alongside hu- mans since before known written history.
They have moved with the human herd as it followed the retreat- Jing ice caps,
settled where people settled
and farmed humanity the way humans cultivate Livestock.
'Thinking this through,
one may reasonably con- clude that if vampires have stalked humans for so long,
they have had plenty of time to study these humans Sone hunters forget,
to their cost,
that all vampires were human,
once.
Some vampires have forgotten that,
too.
To hunt vampires is to hunt an enemy that often knows Man better than Man knows himself.
Vampires are a true apex predator,
often presenting a savvy
and socially aware facade that enables them to blend in with the crowd,
wolves in the fold.
All that being said,
in the eyes of the Aegis Kai Doru,
vampires don?t pose as great a danger to human- ity as that posed by werewolves
and witches.
That"s not to say that the Guardians just accept the vampires? presence in society unchallenged,
however.
Or that the vampires leave the Guardians alone.

'Armageddon to coddle disgraced Servitors.
The only 'angels who will escape this fate are the ones who helped Tomas restore the Tether in Watts,
if they were success~ ful.
The Outcasts have only one hope of clearing their names
(and,
incidentally,
of unveiling the mystery behind the "Fall of the Malakim,
" single-handedly pulling the celestial world back from the precipice of "The Final Trumpet").
That hope is given to one of the Outcasts in a furtive whisper from his Superior - or,
if it makes more sense to the G1,
from Yves or Janus - as he 'turns his back on his loyal Servitor: seek shelter with the dangerous
and unstable Khalid,
Archangel of Faith.
It will be a perilous trek,
making it from California to the

'tribe,
after a long struggle with the elenents,
decided 'that scraping out their livelihood was unreasonably diffi- cult.
Instead,
they lay down on the snow
and waited for 'the elements to kill them.
The elements complied.
Ephah,
a Servitor of Sloth with unusual motivation,
decided that the Tether this event had birthed should be stabilized.
Somehow,
he carved off several of his Prince's Forces to do this with,

and assigned himself the authori- 'ty of a Seneschal.
Having obtained his sinecure,
he felt justified in giving himself a few thousand years of rest.
'Twenty years later,
he was confirmed
and Word-bound by the Lightbringer,
guaranteeing his position.
Three 'thousand,
eight hundred
and twelve years later,
nothing hhas happened.
Well,
one thing has happened.
Hell had forgotten about Ephah
and the Dreaming Ground.
Heaven had never learned of its existence.
Celestials of both sides have passed through the lower Jocus for generations,
unaware
and undisturbed.
Indeed,
'two major Word-bound celestials fought there,
just a few days back,
neither of them realizing where they were.
'Then the eye of Greater Powers fell upon them in an Intervention,

and a surge of lassitude
and Sloth overcame 'them in an instant.
They remain there,
trapped - it?s too 'much bother to leave.
The Tether is more powerful than it has ever been.
Humans,
animals
and celestials who enter its area of influence have a hard time even staying awakes rescuing 'the trapped celestials is nearly impossible.
There is also some concern that the Tether may die in a way that sucks 'the celestial Forces of the captives with it.
The best hope for the Word-bound celestials trapped inside is for something to happen nearby that resonates strongly with their Words.
The resulting surge of ener- gy might give them the strength to escape before the Tether dissolves.
They might,
of course,
survive that dis- solution naturally ~ but the chances for that aren't good.
Servitors might be asked to free one Word-bound,
keep the other side from freeing their Word-bound,
or just hasten the Tether's end.
This can be played many ways,
depending on the PCs
and the trapped celestials; 'two example Word-bound are provided below.
If the group decides to explore the Tether?s influence directly,
they will have 2 harder
and harder time keeping focus.
The GM should play up the effects of the Tether on their minds
and the danger inherent in the situation.


decision was made to settle there.
C-Jammer was guided into a stable orbit
and its engines mothballed,
becoming essentially a new asteroid in the field
and the first inhabited body in the system.
Mining
and industrial settlements were established 'throughout the belt,

and gradually habitation spread to other bodies in the system including gas giant moons
and planetoids in distant orbits.
New Home was the first to build its own colony ship,
which was launched in 4788AD.
Like the original vessels,
this was hollowed-out asteroid.
Although on a smaliisr scale than the earlier missions,
colonists from New Home were able to reach 'of Sturgeon's Law for centuries
and had to learn to live in 'their hazardous environment.
The other ships plied among 'the colonies of the Old
and New Islands,
carrying personnel
and cargo at an incredibly slow pace
and maintaining tenuous contact among the people of the Riftworlds.
'The Rise of the Third Imperium 'The Third Imperium arose around the same time that the ESA colonists arrived in the Islands subsectors.
Tt was not founded as such but was 'restored? on Sylea by the arch-businessman Cleon Zhunastu,
later Emperor Cleon I.
The Sylean Federation at that 'time consisted of 30 or so worlds,

and these formed the basis of 'the new Imperium.
Their charter,
which was largely a free-trade agreement with collective-defence causes,
formed the basis of 'the Imperial Charter.
The planetary
and business leaders of the Federation became the early nobility of the Imperium.
'The new Imperium launched a military campaign to crush the warlords that nibbled at its borders,
then began to reintegrate the worlds of what is now Core Sector.
This was mostly a diplomatic 'and economic exercise though there was some Fighting.
Other sectors followed,

and eventually the Third Imperium expanded 'to fill almost all the space available to it.
Initially this process was

poorly cared for,

and their owners terrible shots.
Still,
et's keep an eye on them.
" "Here they come,
" Ivo said.
A roar went up from the goblin ranks,

and several hundred warriors began to charge the eastern wall.
The elves at the barricades 'squared their shoulders,
their mouths set in grim 'ines as they readied their miskets.
"nt one hundred yards; -volley fire,

The earth shook 'with the thunder of the goblin's charge.
"Rim! A hundred musket barrels snapped into position.
"Fire! With a deafening crash the musketeers fired into the charging goblins,
spitting fire from their muzzles
and filling the air with a cloud of blinding,
'acrid smoke.
Through it Drake heard screams of pain,
rage,

and fear as the elf-shot found its deadly mark.
"Volley by ranks! Right rank,
fire!" Ivo shouted.
Another volley tore into the goblin army.
Drake could see warriors falling into the mud,
to be trampled by 'their oncoming fellows.
"Front rank,
fire! Rear rank,
fire! Reload!" With precision like dwarven clockwork,
the musketeers 'took turns cutting down swaths of the enemy.
But it wasn't enough,

and in moments the goblins were 'at the walls,
stabbing with swords
and spears,

'The musketeers fought back with their bayonets
and 'sabres; some drew charged wands designed for close- range fighting
and aimed blasts of frost
and fire at their foes.
Drake unsnapped the holster at her hip
and drew her wand of ash.
Pointing it at the sky she cried out 4in the ancient tongue.
A fountain of golden sparks leaped from its tip,
rising a hundred feet in the air.
'They swirled,
coalesced,

and all at once the sign of the 'Sumer Queen blazed brightly overhead.
A cheer went up from the defenders.

ROLES.
'ARoleS And Their Purpose Inexperienced celestials often ask what the point of 2 Role is,
feeling they can act more freely without some artificial identity hindering them.
Their elders,
more or Jess gently,
point out the facts: a Role both provides a societal shield for private celestial activity,

and
(possibly more importantly) covers Symphonic disturbance for matters connected with the Role.
'SHIELDING 'SYMPHONIC DISTURBANCE The shielding of Symphonic disturbance only applies 'to damage caused to some part of the Symphony
(humans,
animals,
buildings,
etc) when done as a natural.
part of the Role.
Thus,
a private detective might fire a gun while handling a suspect,
or a rally driver might crash his car while on the track.
Such things as Songs,
attunements,
'and assuming celestial form will not be shielded - it is not part of a policeman's normal duty to use the Song of Thunder on a criminal! Given the importance of secrecy in the War,
it?s often vital to avoid the disturbance that even the most careful celestial produces.
A Role - espe- cially a high-level one,
well woven into the Symphony - can hide this.
However,
no Role can hide everything Symphonically.
'Actions which aren?t part of the Role
(although "human" enough otherwise) may disturb the Symphony.
An angel with a Role as a businessman might help set a bonfire,
or 'a demon with a Role as a television anchorman might accidentally Erash his car.
Both of these would cause 'Symphonic disturbance.
Unfortunately,
no Role is 'strong enough to allow its possessor to live entirely as a 'normal human
(though Asmodeus? Humanity attunement is a trick in itself).
Such deep-cover identities are best left to Saints,
Soldiers,
or undead ~ though Renegades
and Outcasts may try,
desperate to keep their Role
and not cause disturbance that might draw the attention of oth- THE ROLE AS SOCIETAL COVER Ever since the first angel had to walk into a village di guised as a human,

and explain that he was a hunter from over thataway,
it has been important for celestials on Earth to maintain some sort of social identity.

Seraphim dislike this necessity,
while Balseraphs proudly state that they are the person in question.

Temple of the Sun Cabal is designed for four to six Sth level player characters.
In search of a missing vampire,
the PCs are led to a volcanic island in the Midland Sea occupied by fanatical sun cultists.
The cultists plan to sacrifice the vampire in a ritual to summon
and control a long-lost flying temple to the sun gods,

and use its power to "purify" the Dragon Empire by exterminating all other religions.
Can the players prevent the dawn of a terrifying new age,
ruled by a ruthless theocracy of fire? You'1l find a full write-up of Sunlit-which is now a flying dungeon variously known as the Wild Garden,
the Ziggurat,

and the Abomination-in 13 True Ways.
You can use this adventure to bring the dungeon into your campaign as a location to be explored; or if that doesn't appeal to you,
feel free to have it explode spectacularly or crash into the Midland Sea after it's finished serving its purpose as a momentary threat to the world.
Assumptions: This adventure assumes that the PCs have already formed a group
and are open to missions from the icons.
If not,
you may need to introduce additional scenes to get them started.
Time: You should be able to complete this adventure in a single session of roughly four hours.
Adjustments: If you're playing with only three PCs,
you?11 want to make the battles slightly easier.
Bumping the group all the way to seven PCs means that you should add a bit more than another PC's worth of monsters; you'd probably be fine making the battles as tough as they would need to be for eight PCs because of the high number of synergies in a seven-character adventuring group.
Using icon relationship advantages: The Icons sections attached to each scene mention ways that player characters could use specific icon relationship advantages to help them against the temple's defenders
and defenses.
Our suggestions cover what might be accomplished with a 6 result.
If the PC uses a 5,
the player or the GM needs to make the results a bit more interesting than outright success or nullification of a monster ability.
Rather than further complicate a combat scene with a strange consequence from what was intended to be an advantage,
we recommend saving the complications

es + Handbook sound: of a gunshot,
an explosion,
scratching on a door,
a wolf howling,
a beautiful voice or a car accident
(was there a minor thunk signifying a fender bender,
or was there a 'tremendous crash followed by an explosion?).
Make sound effects if you can.
To add to our description of the ashen - faced Vampire we might say "His silk suit rustles as he moves
and his voice is harsh
and raspy,
like a heavy smoker's.
" Now we have to add smell.
Smells really do it for a description of a place in a game.
We identify so many 'things with smell that we don't even realize it.
Pay attention to the smells in your life; they will come in handy as a Storyteller.
Think about the smell of rain,
cars,
alcohol,
sweat,
food,
exhaust,
dust,
stale air,
something dead,
garbage,
the ocean,
the subway
and blood.
Every scene you describe will include smells,
even if it is only the 'smell of mortal vite.
To continue our description of the Vampire with the ashen face we will add a little smell,
such as "His soft clothes are soaked in a thick,
sweet perfume 'that smells of cherries.
' Touch can be used to great effect in the description of a scene,
but it is not essential to every one
(the same goes for taste).
Do not leave touch out though.
Whenever the Vampires make 2 special point of picking something up,
describe how it feels.
For instance when a Vampire draws his gun,
you could say "You fumble inside your jacket until you find it; it seems to slip into your hand
and the icy metal fits snugly into your grip.
" This helps the player experience the Gothic-Punk world to its fullest.
Now if we put our ashen Vampire together we get: "His ashen face glares at you,
with the fangs protruding from beneath the upper lip are as sharp as knives,

and his eyes gleam like two bright coals.
His silk suit rustles as he moves
and his voice is harsh
and raspy,

With 2 montage scene,
you don't need to roll any dice-this is purely narrative play.
A montage scene serves 3 distinct purposes.
The first is to skip over parts of the story that are less exciting than what comes later,
but.
still acknowledge that an event happened or a Jocation has been established
(just like in a movie where 2 long journey is shown as a series of brief mages,
or a location is introduced in a few seconds by showing its most flavorful parts).
The second point is to introduce new characters by having them join the party's adventures in an exciting way rather than a flat 'you meet in a tavern'.
The third purpose of the montage is to re-introduce existing characters,
reminding everybody of their abilities,
personalities,

and relationships.

The only remaining question is how the team will be extracted.
Teatime provides the answer by managing to jettison the MCP containing the jump capsules
and substitute Alert for Defiant Arms as the pickup vessel.
If the mission team has not investigatedthe crash site,
Teatime will do so
and will recover the survivors of the siege,
most of whom by now are wounded
and several possibly dead.
EPLLOG Once safely aboard Argent,
there will be time for congratu- Jations or condolences,
depending on how successful the mission was.
The characters will learn that Wastantan's PAD system was more extensive than had originally been thought,
land so was able to shoot down Defiant Arms.

(This was not Boxcar's fault,
as he had been the operative in Boukart- controlled territory,
not Wastantan.

'ooking for in life.
This is the closest equivalent to a "territory" a Tunnel Runner pup has.
Later in life,
a city,
continent or vast spirit realm may serve as a Runner's stomping ground.
Many Tunnellers have been living on the streets since their youth,
preferring the freedom of the road to the treacherous ways of human society.
Even older Tunnel Runners find it difficult to stay in one nest forever.
Highly- esteemed scouts continue to patrol the same domains for years.
If there's a great place nearby to find food,
adventure,
or perils that threaten the young,
a wise scout or spy will find them quickly.
Culture
and Kinfolk: For all Ratkin,
relationships on the road are temporary
and superficial.
Runii:rs continually rein- vent their identity,
leaving their emotional baggage behind.
Despite this,
long-term friendships that survive common ad- versity are as hard to kill as rats themselves.
A scout or wanderer who hasnt seen an old friend or lover in years immediately picks up the relationship exactly where it left off.
'All Tunnel Runners share a sort of informal shorthand that 'allows them to quickly share information on places they've been,
drawing off the Blood Memories of their profession.
The wisest leave sigils
and graffiti for other wererats to follow.
A Runner Ratkin who's never been to a particular city may have access to all sorts of scattered information he never realized he possessed.
'The Kinfolk Runners breed leam to keep their distance from any long-term social commitment.
Each year,
they move from city to city,
use
and discard temp jobs like old clothes,

and evolve a series of personas for different situations.
Not all of them 'are impoverished
and homeless; as long as you know where to ind crash space,
you're never really helpless.
Rat relatives pride 'themselves on being well-traveled,
possessing extensive knowl- edge about the seediest places in the world.
They are fascinated by places inhabited by other creatures,
especially humans.
Some 'are smart enough to emulate the people they live near; others 'come up with bizarre explanations to explain human activity.
Organization: Once a Ratkin colony is large enough,
it will formally declare itself as a Ratkin "tribe.
" This involves investing its highest-ranking Tunnel Runner as a Scout,
an elder who coordinates the activities of Runners who travel in the region.
Through the Second Sight Gift,
this courtier may even enlist other wererats to act as his eyes
and ears.
If a Ratkin nest is too small to have elders,
then any Tunnel Runners "just passing through" are required to trade stories of their travels in exchange for the support
and safety of the local colony.
Instead of a straightforward military report on the strength of predators in the area,
the data must be con- densed into a format even a small child could understand.
Young pups gather regularly to hear the stories travelers have to tell.
The ones who are most impressed by these fanciful tales 'often become Runners themselves.
'Any major Ratkin realm also has a local "Umbral.
underground" intimately familiar with the spirit world.

Something both widespread
and particularly moving - say ,
a tearful interview on the 'local news about a dead girlfriend â would be worth as much as Â«3.
Druiel,
the angel of Teenage Death,
has a few prob- 'lems on his hands.
It is his job to educate teenagers on the reality of life - that they are not imortal,
no matter what their hormones might lead them to believe.
It is the Fate of some kids to be made an example of so that the rest might Live more prudent lives,
but Druiel
(DREW- ee-el: "Don't pronounce it 'Drool,
'" he snarled at Hugo the first time they met,

and Hugo hasn't done it since.
) felt like he was getting nowhere.
Druiel,
if asked directly,
would admit that he doesn't know quite why he asked for his Word.
He had a lot of romantic ideas about angst
and flowers being picked in their prime,
and.
.
.
asked for the Word of Teenage Death.
He thought that by popularizing the tragedy of 'Lives cut off in their prime,
he could turn mankind's heart more toward its better destiny.

(He also thought he'd get 'to meet the mysterious Archangel of Death,

and is still disappointed he hasn't.
) But perhaps a Seraph wasn't the right angel for this Word.
Unlike most of his Choir,
Druiel really likes peo- ple.
But he doesn't really understand them.
His initial attempts to support his Word,
by glorifying
and roman- ticizing various tragic deaths,
were fruitless.
Eventually he decided that if he couldn't find the "perfect" death to grab people's imaginations,
he?d make it happen.
Yes,
he was killing,
but by picking innocent victims,
he was sav- Jing their souls for Heaven.
Or so he told himself.
So he started setting up the most tragic situations possible.
First a car crash that claimed three victims,
then a couple of drug overdoses .
.
.
picking attractive,
likable victims,
the better to emphasize the tragedy.
So far,
his friends in the Austin celestial community have covered for Druiel,
their loyalty overcoming their discomfort
(even Druiel's denon friends are a little uncomfortable about what he's doing).
But they?re not happy about it.
And there's a question of just how long this can go on,
because ~ of all the celestials in Austin - he's the one closest to getting walloped by an Archangel.
First off,
he?s not exactly helping out children in 2 man- a Right now,
tired of slaying the teens he likes so much,
Druiel's desperately seeking @ broader way to promote his Word.
Inspired by the death of *9s grunge idol Kurt Cobain,
he?s cruising the lively local music scene for an appropriate band to kill.
In the adventure,
"The Denon Prince of Rock
and Roll"
(p.
113),
he finds one.
Druiel serves as a good example of an angel who's gone a bit crazy,
serving his Word
(as he sees it) - though not Heaven.

But Martinez,
Wilson,

and other menbers of the Tribunal presented their case with passion
and convic- 'tion,

and one by one the nations of 'the world became convinced the idea would work.
Eventually the General Assembly voted over- whelmingly in favor of the creation of a treaty to establish this new organization.
'The Tribunal went back to work drafting the treaty.
The seasoned lawyer-diplomat Martinez shouldered most of the writing chores,
with help from his friend Wilson.
Preferring to avoid the 'emotionally-charged terms "army" or "police force,
" 'they chose to retain the name UNTIL for their pro- posed organization.
But the speed with which they completed the treaty only brought them to the final,

Champion Strangling Robes of the Black
(recharge 6+): This strange armor looks Like 2 tangle of black bandages,
held together with leather straps.
In battle,
the bandages writhe
and flail with a will of their own.
When you use the armor,
you may make an opportunity attack on any nearby enemy that provokes one,
even if you're not actually engaged with them.
Alternatively,
if you've got the sneak attack power,
you can activate the robe to have it count as an ally engaged with your target for one attack,
letting you deal sneak attack damage.
Quirk: Speaks in a throaty,
watery voice,
like you're half-drouning all the time.
Epic Scales of the Blue
(recharge 16+): Only sorcerers can benefit fron 'this armor.
Only sorcerers are mad enough to wear it.
This 'armor is made from scales taken from the Blue herself,
living dragonscales infused with the primal magic of the mother of sorcery.
You gain an extra Sorcerer talent,
which must be spent on either Blood Link or Chromatic Destroyer Heritage.
Got both those talents already? Then have a free feat,
which must be spend on augmenting one of those talents.
You may also channel the Blue's power.
This lets you gather power as a quick action,
but the Blue gets a say in the spellcasting.
She might have her own ideas about the choice of targets,
or demand that you carry out some particular course of action or repay her by doing her some service.
OF course,
if you're wearing this armor,
you must be a loyal ally of the Three,

and so you will have no qualms whatsoever about letting her sniff around inside your soul.
Quirk: The dividing Line between you
and Her gets blurrier every day.

The left door is trapped.
The trap can be spotted but not dis- 'armed,
as it is part of the mechanism of the door.
As soon as the door is opened,
a rumbling is heard for one round.
A gigantic crystal sphere will then crash through the ceiling in the centre of the room
and roll down the steps to the socket in room three at the speed of 2 running man.
It is exactly as wide as the stairs 'and does 5d6 damage to anyone it hits.
The Canoptic Guards will 'then attack anyone they can find in the complex.
This room is a mosaic of black
and white tiles.
In the ceiling above each white square is a clay boss in the shape of a distorted human face making a blowing expression.
Each has a small tube visible in its Lips.
Around the edges of the room,
on each of the black 'squares are black sculptures of soldiers.
None of this does any- thing.
The right door is not trapped.

The floor of this room is a six-by-six grid of flagstones.
The room is full of eighteen large clay jars,
set on alternating flags.
There are pit traps directly before both doors,
inside the room.
If either is triggered,
then the triggering PC
and all the jars will drop down twenty feet.
The jars will smash open
and release the salted bureaucrats with the yellowed skulls.
The eighteen empty flags will stay in place.
The walls are covered with exciting scenes of bureaucracy.

You could certainly change the focus in your campaign.

Going back to Webspace,
there are two basic types of space in the Web: Formatted
and Unformatted.
Unformatted Web is any area that hasn't yet been molded into shape by Webspinners or Sleepers.
Formatted Web is everything 'that has.
There are a bunch of categories of Formatted Web,
so we'll start with the simpler one.
Unformatted
(Virgin) Web 'Also known as Virgin Web,
unformatted areas are "blank" parts of Netspace,
areas that haven't been imprinted.
They*re 'the sand waiting for someone to come along
and build a castle,
'the unexplored frontier of the Digital Web.
Unformatted Web's not always found on the edges of known Formatted Space,
though.
Sometimes you find it tucked between two sectors that have been around forever.
No one knows if these

Though its roughly the same size
and mass as an IAV Apocalypse,
a Darkhold resembles no knoun craft in the Galaxy.
It?s unsettling,
alien appearance strains the eyes of any sane creature.
Chaotically-arranged non-Euclidean,
organic,
'or even fourth-
and fifth-dimensional structures emerge from its surface.
No two Darkholds are alike.
One may be configured to resemble a gigan- 'tic insect,
another a four-dimensional sphere,
while 2 third may have a shape that resembles nothing ever seen in Earth's reality before.
Most of the time a Darkhold simply drifts 'through empty space while its Void Messiah "communes with" his King of Edom,
works on constructing or adjusting its weird equipment,
or plans out his next attack.
The space between stars
and Hyperspace are the realms where Earth's reality is at its weakest,

and thus the best place for him to receive prophetic visions.
Consequently a Void Messiah may be sluggish in responding 'to,
for example,
a group of PCs sneaking aboard his Darkhold or an armada of ships assembling nearby
(though his Black Disciples will almost certainly react,
though probably in an uncoordi- nated,
chaotic way).
However,
when roused the Church of the Infinite Dark is a terrible force indeed,
capable of destroying fleets of lesser ves~ sels,
devastating planets,

and even permanently 'transforming stars.
When 2 Void Messiah decides to alter a solar system he does so without warning,
never provid- ing the system's inhabitants with an opportunity 'to resist or evacuate
(though the Church seldom interferes with evacuations when they do occur).
'This seeming heartlessness may be for military reasons,
or it may be because the Void Messiah
and his followers are indeed cruel beyond mea- sure.
It could also be because the energy released by the death of millions or billions of sentients is somehow helpful to their Galaxy-altering schemes.
But the most likely explanation is that like their Qliphothic masters the followers of the Church of the Infinite Dark don't care about the fate of all other 1ife-forms in existence - or,
indeed,
exis- 'tence itself as we understand it.
Which leads to an interesting philosophical question: which is more frightening,
cruelty or indifference? Campaign Use: The Church of the Infinite Dark 'may be the worst threat the Galaxy currently faces.
It's impossible to say whether or not the insane,
Galaxy-altering schemes of its leaders could possi- bly work or even how far along they are with their individual plans,
but their activities have created a 'trail of death
and destruction that even an interga-

Entering Enoch 'As the plane crashes into the catacombs,
the entire place shakes with the impact.
Pieces of fuselage scatter the ground,
'as do the broken bodies of the few mortals who were in the front half of the plane.
Even though the characters witnessed 'copious amounts of seawater flow into the catacombs,
the floors are mostly dry with a few puddles here
and there.
If the characters were in combat when they landed,
they are more than welcone to continue fighting.

A scientist is researching the spiders
and will pay the characters 200 Credits per web; if they aid him,
though,
his Deep-space hulks are old ships,
vessels so old that they have been drifting through space for hundreds of years.
Some are survivors of old battles where the crew was wiped out by radiation or forced to abandon ship; others are the result of misjumps,
where the ship ended up jumping into empty space.
linen a deep-space hulk is detected,
the scavengers may attempt to salvage it.
Not all hulks can be salvaged - a hulk flashing by a settled system at a sizeable percentage of c is unreachable by any conventional vessel.
Other hulks are detected in deep space by long-range telescopes
and can be reached only by jumping into deep space,
with all the risks that entails.
Even if the hulk can be salvaged,
it is a risky proposition.
By definition,
a hulk is a ship where the entire crew died under circumstances that left the ship unrecoverable.
These 'circumstances may never be discovered by the salvage team = the strange case of the Annic Nova is @ classic example - but they may also still pose a threat.
If the crew were wiped out by radiation from a faulty reactor,
then switching back on 'the reactor without checking the safety seals will be fatal for 'the scavengers.
Alien parasites,
lethal viruses,
autonated hunter-killer robots,
malignant shipboard defence systems that interpreted their own crew as threats,
these
and many other potential dangers lurk on board hulks.
If the scavenger is able to recover the hulk,
of course,
the rewards are worth it.
In addition to the scrap value,
some hulks 'are invaluable archaeological finds.
A 5,
000-year old scout ship from the dawn of the First Imperium might only be worth a few thousand credits in scrap but it belongs in a museum.
The vacuum of space preserves what it takes.
Hulk Salvage: When sold for scrap,
hulks sell for less than modern designs
(1/2@th the base value or less) because it is more difficult to salvage spare parts from old designs.
However,
the value of a hulk may be greatly increased if it is of archaeological significance or can be repaired.


physical,
spread far beyond the Legacy he founded.
The early Thrice-Great did not keep their doctrines secret.
In fact,
they 'tried to teach every educated,
philosophically minded person 'they could find,
in hopes they would Awaken as Hipparchos.
After so many centuries,
of course,
the modern Thrice-Great have little hard evidence of their forebears? activities,
but modern Thrice-Great point to circumstantial evidence of the Legacy's influence.
'The far-flung but- secretive religion of Mithraism,
for instance,
built temples filled with astronomical symbolism.
Thrice-Great tradition holds that the central Mithraic image,
of the god killing a bull,
represented the shift of the equinox rom Taurus to Aries.
'The Gnostics â diverse offshoots from Christianity
and 'Judaism â believed that evil,
false gods held souls prisoner in an evil,
false world.
Some Gnostics associated these false gods with the deities of the planetary spheres.
The true god duelt outside the realms of matter,
spirit
and the visible heavens.

Icons & Benefits Once the players have picked their shared Icon patron,

and assigned their other two Relationship points,
it's time to determine if anyone gets any Icon benefits this session.
Each player rolls 1d6 for each Relationship.
On a 6,
that player gets some benefit from the corresponding Icon.
On a 5,
they get a benefit,
but at a cost or with strings attached.
The simplest form of benefit is a new magic item,
like + #1 Inimical Weapon: When you hit with this weapon,
you can deal +1d1@ damage to that enemy,
but if you do,
you also take that extra damage.
+ #1 Bloodthirsty Weapon: When you crit with a natural 20,
you deal crit damage instead of normal damage if you hit with this weapon again during your next turn.
+ #1 Inspiring Weapon: when you crit with a natural 20,
any one nearby ally may roll a save against an ongoing save ends effect.
+ Belt of Vitality: Increase your maximum number of recoveries by 4,

and gain an extra +2 hit points worth of healing when you use a recovery.
+ Alleycat's Cloak: +1 PD,

and gain a +4 bonus to checks to hide in urban environments.
+ Helm of the Herald: +1 MD,

and you can magnify the volume of your voice at will up to that of a giant.
+ Thief 's Eye Ring: Close your eyes; you can now 'see? through the ring on your finger,

and can use it to spy around corners,
peer into small objects
and so on.
+ Potion of Healing: Use a Recovery.
If a player is lucky enough to roll two or more benefits,
don't give 'them two items.
Instead,
tell them to keep the second benefit in reserve,

and to find a way to use it in the game instead.
Perhaps knowledge of the Archmage's secrets helps the PC automatically pass a skill check related to some arcane matter,
or maybe a benefit from the Emperor could be used to rally scared troops during the Defense of the city.


Dungeon Delving Montage 'There are three ways into the Cliff Graves.
'= In through the main entrance
and dungeon crawling down: Run this as a montage with teeth.
One player describes some obstacle or challenge the group faces as they climb through 'the dungeon.
The next player describes how they overcome it.
Optionally,
the GM then asks for a suitable skill check
(DC 15); if the check fails,
the party still overcomes the obstacle,
but one of the PCs loses a Recovery.
'+ Climbing down the cliffs: Why dungeon delve when you can get some fresh air
and exercise by climbing down a perilous,
crumbling,
near-vertical cliff face? The cliff route requires a single skill check
(likely Dexterity,
DC 20); fail,

and it's a very nasty drop
(6d6 damage).
At the bottom of the cliff,
the sea- caves lead up into the grave complex proper.
'= By Boat: The PCs could head to the shore,
get a boat
(see Fight for the Boats,
p.
9),
sail to the sea-caves,

and make 'their way in there.
Exploring the dungeon,
the PCs find their way to Digger's Prison.
Digger?s Prison In many ways,
this is all Digger's fault.
He's a dwarven tomb robber
and treasure hunter.
He'd call himself an adventurer,
but that's not very accurate â he's more the sort of rogue who ambushes the adventuring party when they crawl,
bloodied
and exhausted,
out of the dungeon.


Xuthana's Tale Once healed enough to talk,
Xuthana whispers what happened 'to her.
Long ago,
when she was young
and foolish,
she claimed a spellbook,
which was written by the Wizard King himself â the first ruler of the Empire,
who later became the Lich King.
The evil of the Lich King consumed the book,

and nearly consumed her.
There?s an evil spirit,
or perhaps an evil will,
living within the book.
She was defeated by the Archmage,
who wrested the book from her
and saved her soul.
As penance,
she was condemned to be the guardian of the book,
now called the Chained Tone.
Her young apprentice,
Hathred â he betrayed her.
She doesn't know why; she took the boy in when a storm left him an 'orphan.
He stabbed her without warning.
There was someone else there,
a dwarf who meddled with the chain holding the book = then there was a blast of dark light,

and she knew no more.
She begs the player characters to find Hathred
and recover 'the book.
She knows,
from her own experience,
that the book is flooding Hathred's mind with necromantic secrets that no living mortal should ever contemplate.
He will become powerful
and terrible,
a threat to the whole Empire.
She knows,
too,
that the 'Archmage or some other champion of the Empire will see the danger
and strike Hathred down.
She doesn't want the player characters to save the Empire â she wants them to save the boy.
'Save him before there is no choice but to destroy hin.
Xuthana's Injuries: Xuthana was stabbed with one of her oun knives,
the Eager Dagger.
If a player has a suitably bloodthirsty Icon benefit
(Diabolist,
Orc Lord,
Three etc),
then the weapon slides easily from Xuthana's wound when the PC touches it.
Enjoy your new murder-stick,
0 lucky player character.
IF none of 'the PCs are the sort to wield such a weapon,
then it stays lodged in Xuthana's side.
Either way,
she's too badly hurt to move
and may yet die.
'The Eager Dagger Cursed Champion-Tier Dagger +3 'If the Eager Dagger strikes the first hit in a battle,
'that hit is automatically a critical.
However,
if someone else strikes the first hit,
the Eager Dagger becomes irritated with its wielder; for the rest of the battle,
if the wielder rolls a natural 1,
the dagger bites for 4d8+3 damage.
Quirk: Quick to anger Xuthana's Blessing: Pick the player who offered the most comfort to the wounded sorceress
(or anyone who's got a suitable Icon benefit left to collect â the Archmage,
Emperor,
E1f Queen,
Dwarf King or Priestess would all be good options).
Xuthana whispers a magical secret into that character's ear.
It's a spell that commands the magical chain wrapped around 'the tower.
Once during this adventure,
if the character touches soneone or something
and speaks a word of command,
the chain whips out
(growing longer as needed),
wraps itself around

and recover the remains of Hathred's parents.

Zhodani Society
and Culture History 'The history of the Zhodani people begins with their ar- rival on Zhdant in approximately -302,
000 Imperial.
'In -302,
000,
a fleet of Droyne starships arrived in the Zh- dant system
and within the space of a year or two established 'two settlements or bases.
One sprawled along the western coast of Qiknavra
(the smaller of Zhdant's two continents),
creating large networks of rail-guided grav transports,
sky- 'scrapers in the western mountain ranges,

and undersea dome cities off-shore.
The other settlement occupied a wind-swept desert plain on the eastern limb of Zhdant's tidally locked moon - Viepchakl.
Once the bases were estajlished,
the fleet of ships left; 'their further adventures are unknown.
Zhdant City bred humans over the next century until 'the local human population approached 500,
000.
The uses they were put to remain unclear,
although evidence indicates 'that they were a sort of trained servant or pet.
Known Ancient robots or automatons could have been better servants,
but the Ancients are not known for their understandable or reasonable behavior.
The Final War: Elsewhere in known space,
evidence exists that a devastating final war of destruction against the Ancients began in about -300,
000
and continued for about 2,
000 years.
The war was late in touching Zhdant.
Radio- active dating methods place the first nuclear detonation on Zhdant at 299,
700.
Unfortunately,
that first detonation was swiftly followed by a rain of nearly 500 megatons within the 'space of a few days.
Zhdant City
and Viepchakl City were both destroyed: their structures flattened,
their landscaping 'crushed
and burned,
their mechanisms destroyed.
The orbit- Jing asteroid station was knocked from orbit,
to crash into the ocean
and bury itself in the sea floor.
'Zhdant was devastated.
Dust thrown into the atmo- sphere by the megatons of nuclear detonations gave rise to 'the well-known phenomenon of nuclear winter,
which in turn triggered a Zhdant-wide ice age.
Yet even in the face of this destruction,
there were survivors.
The humans in the city scattered,
taking to the wild.
Gene analysis performed in mod- 'ern times indicates that the total number of human refugees who survived was on the order of 50,
000.
Some Ancients also survived,
likewise fleeing the city for the wilds of the forest 'and the jungle.

The mood of the chronicle overall is one of fatal inevitability.
The players already know,
going in,
that civilization is going to collapse.
The book is called "Fall INTRODUCTION 15 Chapter One: Nights of Glory serves as the beginning of the chronicle.
This chapter describes the relatively 'smooth operation of the Camarilla in its Final nights of undisrupted rule,
giving the characters time to familiar- ize themselves with the setting
and three stories detail- ing opportunities to stake out territory,
establish their reputations
and set themselves up for crucial roles in the collapse of the Camarilla.
Chapter Two: Gods Spearman follows,
setting up four stories that allow the characters to play through several.
crises that crop up near the Camarilla's end,
weakening it
and setting everything in place for the final collapse.
Political infighting,
the shift from religious persecution 'to outright spiritual war
and the death of a Roman En- peror set the stage for social apocalypse.
Characters can choose,
throughout,
whether to fight for the Camarilla in an attempt to shore it up against the threats or to side with the enemies of established Roman society
and try 'to hasten the Camarilla's end.
'And the end soon follows.
Forty years after the end of Chapter Two,
Chapter Three: Vandals in the City of Emperors takes place.
The forces arrayed against the Camaritla crash down upon it like a thunderous wave,
pil- ing upon one another
and annihilating its fundamental structures of order.
Mortal barbarians invade Rome
and sack the city,

and the Striges,
a mortal band of vampire- hunters,
rebel within the Camarilla; all take the oppor- 'tunity to rise up at the same tine,
each trying to smash 'their foes
and grab power.
The Legio Mortuum collapses,
'the Senex is torn to pieces,

and in the middle of it all,
'the player characters fight for survival.
By the end of the story,
the characters are in position to take control of the faction they have allied themselves with â or abandon it 'and choose an existence all their oun.
Throughout the story pages,
a sidebar called The Passage of Events details the important "off-camera" 'moments in the Camarilla's decline,
explaining how the major supporting characters play a role in history
and indicating what happens to them as a result.
The story is followed by three appendices.
Appendix : Sample Coterie provides 2 ready-made coterie of five characters for players to use in the story,
if they wish.
'Appendix II: Slouching Towards Byzantium explains what happened to the last shreds of the Camarilla in 'the years following the chronicle
and tells the story of the Camarilla's failed last chance at re-forming.

The chain takes the most direct route,
so it may end up smashing through the cliffs or crashing across the Isle of Sanctuary depending on where the player invokes the blessing.
If used as an attack,
treat the chain as an attack that uses the character's highest ability modifier + level vs the target's Physical Defence,

A target 'killed' by damage from the chain is dragged away

THE ISLE OF The little island off the coast is a blessed place.
Even in the time before the Archmage tamed the seas
and quelled the storms,
the Little forested isle was a land of peace
and contemplation.
The island is only a short distance offshore,
close enough for an exceedingly strong suimer to brave the currents,
but most of 'those fleeing the advancing undead have taken to fishing boats to cross the waters.
'A few boats still wait at the jetty for stragglers.
If the PCs came straight from the Inn or the Chained Tower,
then there are still crowds of people desperately fleeing the horde of undead.
If the PCs went to the Cliff Graves first,
then the bay is nearly empty; most of the survivors have already crossed to the isle,

and there are only one or two boats left.
Fight for the Boats Turn this fight scene into a montage if you're running short on tine.

Neissure in the stone floor.
The room is filled with an enticing,
spiced-milk aroma.
The plant?s leaves are long
and serrated,
like monstrous tongues,

and they grow abun- dantly from the plant's base.
A bulbous stalk ascends from the mass of leaves,

and is crowned by a ring of tendrils which bob 'and wave.
Each tendril ends in a star- 'shaped ring of leaves,
surrounding a long,
throbbing teat.
'At any time,
there are 1d4 Parts of Xaxus here,
suckling from the teats.
While they 'are suckling,
the Parts are completely help- 'less
and unaware of their surroundings.
The leaves surrounding the teats gently stroke their faces.
This plant,
native to another world,
came here with Xaxus on the obelisk.
It grew here long ago,
tended by Xaxus? first Parts in this world.
It produces a nutritious sap lwhich has enabled Xaxus to survive here without a regular supply of food or water.
The plant can produce enough sap to completely fulfil the daily needs of a dozen adult humans.
Tt takes twenty minutes of dedicated suckling to receive the equivalent of a full meal.
During that time,
feeders are helpless
and oblivious to their surround- ings,
as the plant also produces a hypnotic pheromone that induces feelings of calm,
contentment,

and safety.
The sap is mildly addictive.
If a character feeds from the plant,
have the player roll a d20.
If the result is equal to or less than the 'total number of times the character has fed from the plant,
the character becomes ad- dicted.
Addicted characters who have not fed in the last day take -2 to all rolls as they become obsessed with feeding from the plant again.
These effects last a full month from the last time the character fed.

order to fight a Bale Hound
and her freaky sin-fucking to~ 'tem.
If Chris had known the expression about "discretion being the better part of valor,
" he?d have congratulated himself on his caution.
As it was,
he just lay still,
trying not to tremble or twitch or even breathe too loud.
He needed a piss,
too,

and that was hardly helping matters.
Finally,
the wolf-thing began to dissolve
and vanish,
as if it were turning into smoke
and dissipating.
The mist coiled around Maryann,

and 'emed to be whispering.
Chris didn't even want to know what the spirit was say- ing as a parting note,
but he hoped to God that it wasn't anything like,
"There's a guy hiding in here.
"Another heart beats in this room,
Asah Gadar.
You hhave earned this warning because of your gracious offer- ing.
Until next tine,
then.
" The whispering died down as the spirit dissolved be- fore her eyes completely.
The Bale Hound,
still feeling the 'ache in her brain from the enotional
and spiritual trauma she had suffered this night,
was instantly alert.
"ino's there?" she hissed,
reaching for her silver knife.
She believed she knew who was down here with her,
'Jaying somewhere in the darkness.
Slowly,
again on her hhands
and knees,
she crawled along the floor.
Every time her hand brushed a motionless body,
she rammed down with the knife.
Ghris was far beyond simple panic now.
He could hear her somewhere in the basement,
scrabbling around on her hhands
and knees,

and giggling like a clown as she stabbed into the dead bodies all around.
It was time,
he figured,
to make a scene.
'A scuffle from nearby ~ very nearby â galvanized Chris into action.
He tensed his muscles,
ready to leap up to his feet.
Gunfire rang out,

and the darkness lifted for seven momentary flashes.
Maryann collapsed to the floor,
an- other corpse in a basement full of them.
Chris was a good shot,

and at least three of the rounds had taken the Bale Hound in the head.
Christopher Roof-Runner closed his eyes
and took a deep breath.
It was enough to unbalance his stomach,

and he finally threw up properly.
It felt like part of his soul was 'throwing up,
too.
After he had wiped his mouth on his sleeve,
emptier in more than one way,
he wasted no time 4in making his escape.
'As he crawled to the stairs,
he paused only to spit on Maryann's body,

and throw the gun into a corner.
"Predictable,
my ass.
" 'An injured wolf limped from the house in the sub- urbs.
He knew he'd have to go back to clean up,
soon ~ to do what he could to make the inevitable discovery look 'Like "cult killings"
and "Satanist worship in the burbs.
" But for now,
all he could think of was the lonely ache of a wolf without a pack
and the need to find someone wise who would listen to his story.

Letting the craft go when it is full of water will result in it sinking like a big chunk of metal in the pool at location #9.
It takes one full turn to travel from location #8 to #9 if being merely swept down the whirlpool
(assuming the submarine?s or crane"s crank is not used).
It takes d6r4 turns if using a crank to ease the craft dow without damage being taken by the passengers.

Once down in the lower cavern at location #9,
the only ways back up is to either work the crank from inside a tube

Landing Pool 'The whirlpool from the water in location #8 empties here,
out of a drain specifically constructed so descending craft would not crash into the cavern walls on their final descent.
Craft will splash down directly below the drain
(a forty foot drop),

and will imediately start to sink if the cable hhas been allowed to go slack
(the water there is sixty feet deep).
The correct procedure to get the craft to shore is to use the crank to lift the 'craft back out of the water
(and it will be hanging on end).
Someone must 'open the hatch
and swim to shore while carrying a shoreline,

and then the craft should be pulled into shore as someone within is letting out more cable.
Along the shore are several stone pylons which can be used to secure the watercraft.
There is also one of the submarines moored here.
While there were six dwarf sentinels within,
these have been destroyed,
so they are simply dwarf corpses.

'THE CLIFF GRAVES 'The sea-cliffs along the Denon Coast have been used as a burial 'ground for many ages.
At first,
the dead were interred in natural sea-caves at the base of the cliff,
looking across the waves to the Isle of Sanctuary.
Over the ages,
the fame of the site grew,

and many wealthy nobles or fallen heroes were laid to rest here.
The faithful dug tunnels
and galleries into the limestone cliffs,

and carved more burial chambers higher up on the cliff face,
all the way up to the temples they built atop the cliffs.
'And then the earth quaked,

and the hollowed-off cliff partially collapsed
and fell into the sea,

and the renoun of the cliffs faded.
The locals continued to use the upper levels of the cliff as their graveyard,
burying their dead in the rubble of the 'temples,
but the cliff graves were mostly forgotten by the people 'of the Dragon Empire.
Or,
to put it another way: it's a partially-flooded vertical 'dungeon full of undead.

Darren's recent decision to join the Knights 'of Rage,

A well- known philanthropist who has donated millions that he made during the Novatech IPO to various charitable organizations,
he is rumored to have political aspirations

Richard

Many Campaigns,
Many Gods If you have been running other fantasy roleplaying games,
you may already have a d20 pantheon or two you enjoy using.
We think the pantheons in most every edition of the d2@ roleplaying game are pretty good.
We've used gods from each of the other d2@ games in our campaigns,
alongside gods we made up,
gods from fantasy novels,

and gods worshipped by many human cultures.
Norse
and Greek
and Celtic
and Egyptian gods resonate well with some players.
Our standard explanation for bric-a-brac pantheons is that the Dragon Empire is a lot like many early fantasy roleplaying campaigns,
containing interesting fragments of many intersecting worlds.
Shipwrecked survivors of other oceans crash onto the beaches of the Iron Sea.
Fragments of other realities surface in living dungeons
and drift into the world on flying lands.
Immigrants from any reality you want to use in your game could have come to the Empire in the near or distant past.
Gods are tenacious survivalists.
Once they reach a world,
they have a knack for surviving.
Feel free to arrange any backstory you like for a deity or pantheon.
Your campaign's alternative: If you're not happy with the multiversal deity approach,
use the pantheons you prefer or the pantheon your players are most comfortable with,
or make up a pantheon that suits the campaign you are about to run.
In my campaign,
you can worship whatever gods you like
(though it hardly matters),

and people talk about "the gods" almost abstractly.
The gods are behind everything but distant from everyone.
Who made the world? The gods.
Who gives clerics their spells? The gods.
Who sanctifies marriage
and enforces oaths? Who oversees the rise
and fall of nations? The gods,
that's who.
While almighty,
the gods are distant.
Perhaps the evil or pathetic behavior of mortals has driven them far away.
The gods still heed some people: prophets,
clerics,

and congregations singing the sacred hymns.
'The people worship various gods,
excluding few
and fearing none.
There are countless cults,
traditions,
holidays,

and sacrifices devoted to particular gods,
but all these things are mortal doings.
myths
and traditions vary from city to city
and age to age.
The gods themselves never make any sort of direct appearance.

vampires? actions might bring 'them into conflict with the Guardians' interests.
Bloodsuckers don't like to leave clues which might 'lead humans to become aware of their existence.
AS such,
most cities have dedicated cabals of vampires whose mission is to go around "cleaning up" scenes of supernatural incidents.
This includes using Dread Powers such as "Alter Memory"
(p.
169) on witnesses to cloud their recollections of events.
'As Guardians prize knowledge,
some of which is stored in the memories of witnesses to super- natural incidents,
they frown upon anything that occludes that knowledge
and erases evidence.
This goes double for evidence of vampiric interventions,
including documents,
sites of unusual activity,
discarded corpses
and blurred photographs of the vampires themselves.
Sometimes it's not an individual vampire that steps on the Aegis? toes,
but a whole accursed coterie of them-even the vampires? equivalent of a compact or even conspiracy,
such as the Victorian pseudosci- entific vampire cult that occasionally tries to interfere with an Aegis investigation.
hen the local blood- suckers begin taking a collective interest in the Aegis Kai Doru,
the Guardians band together to fight back Jin order to preserve their assets.
And their necks.

'Atidis point on,
when the snake has its turn,
it will automatically miss.
We dort want to Kill you on your first training game,
but you should recognize how often it might have hit you,

and how often you are likely to have made your saving throw.
Fighting in this game is very dangerous.
Keep rolling to hit until you have succeeded in bringing the snake to op.
Once that happens,
it is incapacitated,

and you can easily finish it off.
Note that if you are ever brought to @hp,
you too will be unconscious,
or A Gruesome Discovery You are hurt after the battle with the snake,
but there are more important 'things on your mind right now.
There's still something under this cloth,
'and it would be risky to leave it in case it is another dangerous creature.
You use your sword to 1ift the cloth
and throw it across the room,

and what you reveal beneath it shocks
and disgusts you - here is the fresh corpse of a man! It seems something has torn into his gut,
ripping his belly wide open.
You are no stranger to death,
having seen grievous wounds during your tour of duty in the military,
but in this situation,
on a floor in 'a house,
viscera exposed
and falling out of the open wound,
it just seems unnatural.
And the edges of the wound.
.
has something been eating the man's flesh? You shudder.
Another reminder that in the full game,
you choose whether to do all this or do something else instead.
Yet.
within his hand,
the one you hadn't uncovered earlier,
are two small red stones that shine in your lantern light.
An intruder wouldn't just walk 'around with such things in his hands,
so he must have found them here! There is treasure to be found! Money can't help the dead,
so you collect the gems off the corpse
and begin to search the desk.
You find nothing,
not even old papers,
but in 'the middle of your search you hear a small Erash from outside the door.
Fearing that the monster from earlier has returned,
you rush out the door to confront it! But there's nothing there.
Turning left,
you continue down 4 'the original hallway.
You come to a large room,
perhaps once a dining room.
A number of hallways
and doorways lead from the room,
and.
.
"pssst.
Come here,
quick!" From one of the doorways you see the face of a woman,
maybe the same 'age as you.
She's motioning for you to join her.
Advancing carefully,
you see that she has no weapons in her hands,
so you let down your guard
and enter the room.
"Put that lantern out! They?11 see!" she hisses through gritted teeth.
You shutter the lantern,

and all goes dark,
with only the moonlight slicing the gloom through the slits of the boarded windows.
It is Light enough to see that she is wearing chain armor,
much like yours,
'and carries a mace that hangs from her belt.
Around her neck is the symbol of the largest church in town,
so she*s obviously quite religious.
"tino are you,

and what are you doing here?" you ask.
"Keep your voice down!" she spits at you,
tugging you down so you're sitting on the floor as she is.
"My name is Alice,

and I came here with my partner Tolliver to catch a criminal.
But we were ambushed
and before we could.
oh,
you're wounded! She sees the bites you suffered from the snake.
"I am a cleric,
" Alice says.
"I can heal you if you agree to help me.
This makes sense.
You know that a Cleric is a type of occupation that

dumps a mage"s net-based Paradox; he can return a minute or so afterward with no ill effects.
Getting Outta Dodge A large-scale Whiteout - that is,
one involving more than 10 points of Paradox - signals its approach with lag.
Every character nearby,
except the one who provoked the backlash,
gets 'one action in which to ditch out
and avoid the blast.
In game 'terms,
this involves a roll of Wits + Computer,
difficulty 8.
Success means that a character was able to drop offline in time 'to escape the Whiteout.
Failure means that character gets hit with half damage as well,

and 2 botch means the character takes full damage.
If a bystander plans to stay online
and ride out 'the backlash,
then she takes half damage from the Whiteout.
'The person who triggered it,
however,
has no such options.
He?s stuck.
It's worth mentioning that folks who court Whiteout aren't terribly popular online.
Digital Damage Despite the transhumanist ideal of leaving one's imperfect body behind,
most netizens visit the Digital Web through projected minds,
not physical forms.
So what happens when 'they get hurt or die online? That depends.
.
.
Bashing,
Lethal,

and Aggravated Damage In the Digital Web,
combat follows the usual rules.
Characters still use their Stamina to soak damage.
Although 'the settings may be bizarre ~ adding to or reducing dice pools
and difficulties - the physics play out in the usual way.
The primary difference between them cones through in the damage suffered through such attacks.
For sensory or astrally immersed netizens,
most injuries involve bashing damage.
System shock
(headaches,
nervous 'twitches,
fatigue,
etc.
) may affect the end user back hone,
but with a few exceptions,
those injuries clear up quickly.
Netizens refer to such injuries as egg-frying: your "egg"
(head) gets a bit fried when you tangle with folks online.
Holistically immersed people,
on the other hand,
suffer damage as if Netspace were normal space.
A punch inflicts bashing damage,

and 2 gun deals out lethal damage.
Because 'there's no icon to take the punishment,
an HI visitor suffers 'the consequences.
That's the primary reason folks still prefer astral visitation over full-on immersion.


Celestial Combat A celestial attack tears aay at the resonance that makes you what you are .
.
.

and if you are hurt too badly,
you are not.
'This is soul-to-soul combat,
a battle of wills.
It can 'take place in any realm,
but in the corporeal realm,
the wearer of a physical vessel is shielded from blows against the will.
However,
someone in celestial form is always vulnerable to celestial attacks! This is the only way to do combat in the celestial realm.
Creatures without Celestial Forces cannot be harmed by celestial combat.
Celestial forms on Earth are not automatically

Just as a Role can provide cover from Symphonic dis- turbance,
it also provides a shield from the inquiries of friends,
neighbors,

and policemen.
A "public identity" 'can give reasons for a celestial to be in some area,
taking some action,
or holding that smoking gun.
Even if it doesn't entirely shield him from detection,
it may keep him out of the hands of police
(or others)
and preserve his freedom of action.
Also,
a Role allows celestials to interact with mortals in order to accomplish their tasks,
without the mortals becoming aware of the existence of angels or demons.
This is quite important,
as Servitors of Dominic
and Asmodeus will explain to those who trans- gress too publicly! 'SERAPHIM AND ROLES It is extremely difficult for a Seraph to sustain a Role which is a lie - and,
on occasion,
impos- sible.
However,
it is not necessarily a lie for a Seraph to tell people to call him by some name
(particularly one close to his own),
or show 'them a piece of laminated cardboard with a name printed on it.
Furthermore,
if a Seraph 'spends time
and effort on some job - his Role - 'then it is entirely true that he works as a profes- sor,
lawyer,
schoolteacher,
or whatever.
A Seraph can sustain a Role backed by docunen- tation if he presents it carefully,

and a Role backed by actual work if he does the work.
Seraphim prefer high-level Roles precisely because they can live so much of the Role that there are very few lies involved.
A celestial's Role is an important tool which a celestial can use to deal with humans on equal terms,
subtly influ- fencing society
and the Symphony for good or evil.
Some 'are amused that they are using human society to adjust 'itself.
Some - especially Impudites
and Mercurians ~ 'appreciate humans more for it.
Others are disgusted that they are forced to sully then- selves with the petty appear- 'ance of humanity ~ but even they admit that it is useful,
if they are to affect human behavior.
The Status of a Role is also useful for apply- Jing societal or monetary

The Tower of Xaxus,
Level 2 45.
This room is warmed
and lit by an ron brazier,
which is burning fiercely.
The room's sole window,
in the south wall,
has been covered by a thick but moth-eaten rug.
As a result the room is smoky but warm.
Several pallets have been made up fon the floor,
made from rugs
and tapes- tries collected from around the complex.
'At night,
there will be 6 randomly-chosen Parts of Xaxus sleeping here,

and during 'the day there will be 1d6 Parts napping or quietly conversing.
The walls of the room are carved to look 'ike large wooden panels,
four on each wall.
One panel on the east wall hides a secret door.
It pivots on a horizontal axle 'through its centre,

and the lower half of 'the panel can be pushed inwards to reveal.
'a hidden chute,
which drops into location 11.
However,
the chute is very tight,

and there is a skeleton wedged in the exit.
The first person down the chute will take 144 damage as they crash through the moulder- Jing bones.
Worse,
the bones are covered in a yellow mould which will burst into a fine mist of spores if the skeleton is disturbed.
Everyone in the room below
(location 11) must save or die coughing up blood.

A stone stairway curves around the east
and north walls of this small room,
'and there is a large window set in an alcove under the stairs.
The window has the remains of an iron grille,
which appears to have been recently repaired with rough 'twine.
The room has been swept clean,
but remains of gulls' nests
(sticks,
seaweed,
faeces,

and broken shells) can be found in corners
and crevices.


The Ai'T3I/ane The sights
and sounds of human suffering are thick here.
The emergency hatchways have been opened,

and rescue workers are working through the wrecked body of the plane attempting to remove survivors first,

and to catalog the dead last.
Some of the survivors are moving 'out on their own,
milling around aimlessly,
huddling with one another in thin airline blankets,
drinking out of police thermoses
and crying.
Most of the police
and rescue workers are tired
and impatient; they just want to keep the scene from erupt- Jing into even more chaos,

and want to get home to warm beds.
Some of them are crying,
too.
The PCs may end up interacting with any of these,

and 'can get the following information: Plane Survivors: Any of the surviving airline passengers will tell a similar story
(the G1 should toss in the occa~ sional error or contradiction in detail,
though; these People are having a bad night).
The flight took longer 'than it should have,
because of the weather.
There were gunshots
(six gunshots; few passengers will get the nun- ber right if pressed); the plane started to drift.
The passengers panicked.
After about 10 seconds the plane seemed to be riding well again,
but with a sickening sen- sation of downward movenent.
Much more like a landing than a dive,
but unexpected
and somehow erratic.119.

By the 'time most of the passengers noticed that they werent heading toward a real runway,
there was nothing but screaming.
'The GM should note that many of the passengers on.
'the flight speak only Spanish or Portuguese; only about half speak English.
First-time flyers won't give as much information.
Highway Survivors: For those on the ground,
it was over very quickly.
The whine of jet engines isn't unusual along this stretch of highway
(in fact,
a few can probably be heard while the PCs are listening),
but one grew very 'loud very quickly.
The next thing people knew,
the car next to them was vaulting along in a pinwheel of flame,
'and their own roof was being half sheared-off by a wing.
Sone will have crawled out of cars that were partially 'crushed,
or those that were tossed.
T he range of injuries is great,
from those with minor lacerations
and bruises to 'those smeared along 200 feet of icy highway.

and Rescue: In the last minutes of Flight 8081 's descent to the highway,
