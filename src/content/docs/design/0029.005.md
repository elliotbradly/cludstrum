now some sad ness
because it looks like the short bit you wrote yesterday is gone 
the saga of big boy comes to an end 
what is next 


so right now 
at this one minute 
i want to play a game 

i really do 
i so want to play a game  
let us look over at kong 

so what game would i like to play 
i would like to play a game 


the coding block is in place 
now 
just a big block 
did i take too much 
is that why i can not do anything 
did i mess it up again 
yep
i can not feel my mind like normal 
my motor skills seem to be difficult to appreciate 
i suppose i could just drift off and watch tv 
but i want to 
sigh and spin 
and now we just write no matter how slow or how much time it takes to get the words out on the screen 
this is what you wanted the brain fire 
there you go you have it and maybe you will not hate yourself for it 
you just want to go go go 
that is all 
just like a man 
so where will we be going to day 
i do not know as the mind chasm continues 
ok are we functioning again 
yes i believe so 
tell me about the life of big boy 
how long we had the bull i do not now 
but i remember when he went down 

the ripple of sun light bouncing off the water and hit the bull on the chin 







i am surpised that this is not updating 

so we decide to go in all the way 
just make a week out of it 
you could handle it for one day but 
that was all 
now here you are pooring out the guts of the previous evening 
you should have just sat there 
such a dummy 
and the month of may ends 
this is exactly what it is for 

go ahead and make me feel like bull shit 
you do that better than anyone i know 




SIGH.on(E.DARK_FUL, darkFull)
    SIGH.on(E.DARK_MID, darkMid)
    SIGH.on(E.DARK_OFF, darkOff)
  

    darkFull()

    setTimeout(darkFull, 1333)

    setTimeout(() => colorBG('#005500'), 5555)


oh well 
it came to a close 
the poem the beauty the verse 
where would it pop up from again was a mystery 
from the memory loss drug 
from the converstation poetry 



  var showBG = () => {

    var clr = convert.hex.rgb(pb.bgClr)
    pb.bg = 'background: rgba(' + clr[0] + ',' + clr[1] + ',' + clr[2] + ', ' + pb.val + ')';

  }


  var colorBG = (hex) => {



  }

  var darkFull = () => {

    TweenLite.to(pb, .5, {
      val: 1,
      onUpdate: showBG
    })


  }

  var darkMid = () => {

    TweenLite.to(pb, .5, {
      val: .5,
      onUpdate: showBG
    })

  }

  var darkOff = () => {

    TweenLite.to(pb, .5, {
      val: 0,
      onUpdate: showBG
    })

  }

  var bgShift = (img) => {

    darkOff()
    colorBG('#FF00FF')
    setTimeout(() => colorBG('#FF00FF'), 555)

    var loc;
    if (CONTAINS(img, '.png')) loc = 'url(bgx/' + img + ') no - repeat center center fixed '
    else loc = 'url(bgx/' + img + '.png) no-repeat center center fixed'

    trace("show me loc " + loc)

    document.body.style.background = loc;

    //document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].style.backgroundImage = loc;

  }


ok alright 
here we go 
adjusting to the new environment 
hot air with a breeze 
laughter and shrills from those on holiday 
the gator man found himself with out the answer he wanted 
the family friend from the family of beeings 
tasted salty once again 
now there had been the issue of the narrative logos 
who would this beling to  
of course the designer elliot bradly 
who was designed by brad elliot henderson 
it is ok to be bright 
bright as a adjective 
versew
white as a noun 

ok the quests and the characters and the king of america 
do some tricks clown 

the power to control cows 


well 
ok 
the idea of the one who wishes to be a spouse 
there would be more than a few of these characters 
here are we once again in abstractvile  
wondering which fishy you are about to catch 



new ideas new ideas 
will you come forth 

neil gamian as an ultimate self 
too much pop reference 

but yes come back to the game 
so would you please chooose for me a character 
you must keep going 
the brain needs something 
and a few failures 
more than a few 
unable to stay up late and be given the secert 
unabale to keep teeth brushed 

feel free to feel the unerring chains of this one character 
quixxy quinnicillipann 
all he wants is to keep all his teeth until he dies 
that is his passion 
there is a zero sum game that he must play
the game ends when he dies or loses one tooth 
which would result in his death shortly 
so here we go with a little cameflouge in the shape of cards 

five tests 
there would be this moment in the future where if he made all the write choices 
he gets to keep his teeth

20 gigs

why do you not go read a book 
we have plenty of those 
three billion  fourty thousand and six hundred and two billion in fact 
so many books 
the best are on these shelves up here
the body of the iceburg lies below in valut after valut after valut after storage unit 
sometimes i go down a try to find one worthy of being up here 
am pretty sure my curation up here is complete 
its been at least ten thousand years since a blessed, bounded, pastoral or primal has discovered another work of letter worthy of my praise 
the others once written if they show any originality at all go bellow 
but why am i telling you all this after all you are not interested in books
no you want choices 
well guess what 
all the simulations have been checked out 
yep it true 
sorry but its been that way for at least a decade 
i keep believe one day the fad will end and books will enrich our minds once again

i mean there is this one little one over here that was amoung the first
but it is so pitiful that it needs to be discarded 
we do not really have any use for it anymore 
if i could only find someone with the heart to take it off my hands 
here you can have it since you are so interested in sims
its called the perfect beeing simulation 
an all american alligator fantasy 
could a designer come up with an even more ridiculous title  

have you heard of it before 
nope 
not surprised 
yep 
well i guess you are a choice connoisseur 
here take the deck of cards and what ever you do 
please do not bring it back 


the o


the idea of deck building 
who is coming with me 

so in astrokahn 
they have books 
but they have decks also 
magical simulations in the form of a card game  
and these decks contain all the rules required to play games 
heh heh 
they was a time when people came to the library to read books 
now they come to play games 
mostly all games are card games 
there is a game called perfect beeing 
do you want to hear the rules 
cylopiean anglify says all these things 
when you hit the site for the first time 

ok so there are four colors 
the game ends when the 

paint maxes out 
or all animals turn primal 
or all the people turn bounded

so then the turn based story begins 

so as a player you get a series of turns 
which all at tied to the clock 

ok show here we go 
you handed a combination of 
avas and locations 

you choose who dies 
every location has multiple ways of destroying a card 
after this happens narrative panels are introduced showing the demise of the character

ok then astral stops what he is doing and goes to investigate 

each characters is represented by a deck of cards 
during every turn you get handed a character deck 
you select the option that you wish to happen 

out of three potential options 

changing a location changes out the cards in your hand 
but each turn results in you choosing a character 
then choosing a card 



there are quest cards 
get out of lixie dixie 
get out of detriot 
become the art champion of the world 
with slots 
when they are complete 

there are two location decks 
beetroit and lixie dixie 

ok each character has two differnent version 
a bounded and blessed 
but maybe you do not know what they are 

in fact all you see are the choices you have to make 






avas are


you choose which one dies

angylph : so what is this all about 



  //i prefer art bots instead of aborted babies when i read specutalive fiction 



alright here we go 

let me sit back an attempt to figure all this out 

a sea of letters is called the spooge 
the who who clicks last is a stooge 



taking resposibility for your mistakes as we attempt to build a maze 
that ends in ruin or reward

the story is told by multiverse explorer astral wylde 
there are records stored in astokhan on everything 
and during one of his less fuitful periods he decides to investage chains flowingf
from the life of a beautiful painter he once knew

astral wydle because of his supernal nature is gifted with perfect memory
and he remembers watching a video from mica metrological in his flamboyant style 
talking about a thirty percent chance of rain that evening 

he remembers being at the gory hole
a progressive mid tier art gallery in a trendy section of beetriot
known as the bridge of noise
when he first learns all of beetriot is laughing at triton arcage again
as he observes the details of a painting at show known as the Triumph of the Colored Venus
that features a group of lesbian women of darker color trampling
on the faces of a group of contempory news worthy white men 
by emerging twenty something artist cherp cherp quint known for her delicate Rococo Style

he overhears Saul Saint Nicodemous giving cherp cherp a critique of the piece 
with a group of other artist friends including 
katharsis gale the oldest of the group in mid fourties
bransky bronze bright supermacy in her early thirties

bransky and chirp standing sliently noding there heads in approval 
as saul saint goes on and on with bullshit language about destruction of the 
partiarchy
colonialism
and queer theory
and other fashionable topics of art conflict during this time period

at the end of the sanction
astral can not help himself and says something of a smart assed nature about his unoriganality
leaving the others shocked
while kat unable to control herself goes on a giggle

saul and brankys backs away with out a retort in digust and heads for the wine bar wonder about the homeless nature of astral
and wondering if he comes from the land of lixie dixie

the dealer of gallery motions to cherp to come her way because a collector is interested in buying her work 
leaving astral and kat together 

she makes an excuse to leave
he mentions that he has seen her work before 
but astral replies with a comment so disarming to that kat can not help but fall in love with him on the spot
and they sneak out into the night air together

as they walk along the peppled path of a converted bridge from an abadonned subway train
the converstation unexpectedly turns back to triton and his first failed pridiction 
twenty years ago 
here astral learns about about someones world who did end that day 
kat had an abortion due to a burst condom 
from the man ari bloomfield
who had been scientist visiting beetriot from the orient five years her senior 
she had a nickname for him 
beastiari 
because of the obsene amount of dark blue brusies he would leave on her neck 
luckly it was the winter so she could get away with wearing scarves all winter long 

she had oh so many lovers that winter of so much snow

while the love affair progressed 
another lover appeared on the scene 
the first lover 
art hallow 
who later became a preacher
the one who took away her virginity on her twenty first birthday

she had gotten Cholera from some sushi mysteriously and he just appeared
he had left her three years ago to persue a music carreer out or another girl out west 
she could never be for sure 

but there he was back on the scene 
meaning well but rarely doing well 

on the morning of the first doomsday pediction kat and beastiari went to the clinic for the procedure
it turns out this day 
the day astral and her meet are the anniverary of that event
for some reason art knocked on my door that day
but i told him that it was not a good time 
ari was on the other side of the door with me 
and i remember him being so scared 
art was a big man well a tall man 
but i think he had a streak of cowerdace in him 
and i do not think i could ever rely on him for protection 
but yes someones world did end that day 

moments later the rain came down in sprinkles

she mentions that she knows what the name of the child would be

the rain gives her an oppertuinity to part 

as they part she ends by stating that she does not regret it 
the abortion 
and that she never regrets anything 
and she says good bye
and they part as the first snow of the year comes down just a little harder

astral triggers an wad odd to look after her

but that night she went home 
her rich younger tech founder boyfriend at the time comes over 
damemian luxe
she drinks alone since he refuses to drink for fear it may destroy cell in the brain he worships 
and he tells her about the great egg drop
for a tremendous number of bits you can send an alligator turtle egg into space 
and follow it throught out its life 

she thinks it to be a complete waste of money 
better spent on the needs of others less fortunate 
but he will no be persuaded

first the player selects a rocket ship going out into space
they go out into space for a variety of reasons 
some go out for mining purposes 
some go out for educational purposes 
some go out for transportional purposes 
some go out for recreationial purposes 
some go out for aggressive purposes

the rocket ships are named after ancient tractor brands 

oliver 
allis chambers 
Farmall 
International Harvester

they each have a departing time 
a few hours away

then they get to choose a natural perseve in which to to place 
the creature 

the okeenokee snow swamp is on the list
but it cost extra because the embroyo will need some genetic modifacations 
in order to survice the winter 

choose the type of weapon used to protect the creature 
shot gun 
flame thrower 
blade 
electric shock

the next choice is the color of the eye 
red, purple, yellow, blue, black 

are all on the list

only two more choices remain
gender and name

they must give it a name before the transaction is complete
he is coming up with dumb sounding names 
like killer crack 
or soap sud 

but she become animated about the naming

ok he agrees to let her say the name as long as he gets to choose the gender

she names the creature 
focus
little focus

the company making the trips has a deal with the corpertation running the game 
a small pod made out of exotic matertials are attached to the pod 
shortly after the transaction takes place
the automated machines placing the object are quick in their work 
and on the screens of the customer a count down commences depending on the departure 
time of ship 

that is just enough time to bring you to a sigh and spins in the dark 
he says

kat is not too interested in that affair 
and send him away 
saying see needs to paint 

he leaves pouting 

and see sit long on the couch 
waiting for the countdown to complete
and takes a quick nap 
walking up in time to see the launch of the ship 

deluxe is online too 
and commits to taking the landing manually 
their is an argugement as to what they should do as the egg continues to fall 

now the ship could not make into the atomsphere 
and crash and explode 
but that depends on a choice she makes in the future 

or most likely it does take off 
reaches the correct orbit and lanches out in to space 
where gravity begins a gentle kiss and begins to pull it down 

here several things can occur before the pod takes a good or poor landing 

crashing into a googazoid delievery agent 
beeing shot down by an terrioist asshole with rockets 
hitting a birds 
cooling panels not functioning 
bad spin 
too quick of decent 

there will be no refunds should something desatrous occur

there is a cotton candy shield that can be equip to save it from certain dangers

and finally 
there is the parachute 
and the biggest question of all 
when to launch it 

it lands in the swamp 
the question when it emerges is did the egg crack and become destroyed 
or did it make it safely to the earth 

if they land it there relationship bonds closer 
if the creature dies 
then kat break out into tears and the relationship is pretty much over

what is left of the pod will form into a a small robot 
that will track and follow the creatures every move 
untill the creature dies which cause the robot to self destruct into compostable matierals 
that turn into ash 

a hawk would like to eat the baby 
alligators will eat the baby 
snakes will eat the baby 

for the duration of the expierence 
we will constiantly return to observe the goings on of focus 
the age of the turtle is constistanly displayed on the ui that the user with the correct url gets to observe 

oh the protective robot can also act as a shield 

the alligator snapping turtle will not have landed for more than five minutes
when it catches the eye of a much larger real alligator colored with bright yellow textures
the gator may go in for the kill 
but before it does a giant spear pins it to the ground through its tail 

the robot hurries the alligator snapping turtle on to a floating lilly pad 
and out of the scene 

the spear belongs to rc spurl 
he is on an alligator hung and has found his prey 
the alligator snarls and hisses violent as it is unable to move 

oh you are going to be a big boy huh 
he winks at drone that is recording the expiernce 
on the top of the the drone is countdown which shows just how much time 
has passed since the delivery began 

deliveries usually go to middle class couples looking to feed there families 
but this one wants something a little more exotic sence they are entertaining a politician that night
its considered that wild galligators since the meat is tougher that it contains more flavor
they were willing to pay the extra delivery fee for this one and it is a big 12 footer 
which should fect about 6 lbs of meat 

as rc gets closer the animal is so large and strong that it breaks free from the hold of the weapon 
by breaking the weapon 

see rc could die in this encounter 
it is a possiblity 
the alligator will do its best to make it so 

rc is not pleased because he liked his spear quite alot 
but it was about time for it to break 
since the abouts during about every twenty deliveries

leaving rc defenseless
but he is ready 

he first takes off his shirt 
oh course the alligator could choose to attack then which would be terrible 
yup there a some powerful muscles in play there 
he needs to the shirt to throw over the eyes of the alligator 
if he is successful then the alligator will be disoriented 
and he could jump on its back 
take off the shirt 
cover the eyes of the animal 
and gather hold of its mouth 
extremely dangerous 

then he would need to fashion a clamp on the mouth 
and make sure the then tie the legs together 
then he would be free to chop of the tail 

every delivery champion holds a different style
rc likes to go a lone 
but he is really expierenced 
he also like to use a spear so he can surprise the animal from a distance 
by throwing it 
it rarely misses 

the spear can also be used to remove the tail 
he is a champion so does his best not to kill the animal 

after the tail is removed 
he whipes so goo glip on it that speed up the healing time 
now the alligator just needs a few months in the sun and this tail will return 

it takes out a few knives 
and removes the tenderloin from the the tail 
weight it 
it takes out a roll of plastic carried by the droid that is following him around 
covers the pink muscle in it 
and places it inside the device 
hit a button and one part of the time stops
and new timer begins which records the amount of time it takes to take the meat to the customer in beetriot

oh it is much slower time than normal 
do to the breakage of the spear 

he starts making his way out of the swamp by jumping on a boat 
in a few minutes his drone tells him his account has more money in it 

he shoots the boat out of the swamp 
and find a little water hole name club five oh five 
to enjoy some of the earnings of the day 

there is a waitress here
cecilia rogers rules 
whose legs he likes 
he asks her out again 

she reminds him that he has been asking her out for the last four months 
and the answer is still no 

feed kornblith comes in 
another delivery champion 
who struck out for the day 
cause it took too long to complete the delievery 
so rc buys him a drink 
and he tells him a secert 
that he knows where there is a tremonduos amount of gator crust 
that could be theres 

or in one thread the object crashes on the dock of Foggy Sweets Vapors of the Occult 
on the outer perimeter of Lickskillet the largest town and muniple capital of Lixie Dixie
while Foggy and Kbar are commiting to a new business deal 
for the past few years kbar has been buying empty vape bottles 
it buys them to fill with blood 
there is small but profitable market for alliagator blood 
for a race of vampire bunny humanoids that secertly exist in the world
a few dozen for a bronzed sealed skute 

the noise spooks them 
they go back inside and begin to discuss things 
kbar is looking for a buyer 
someone on interested in gator crust 
something that could be turned into so many things with minimal effort 
the got a freind who works for reptique and he will make the call 

kbar goes back to his gator farm 
pounds primative

simon bee is finishing painting the outside walls that protect the business green 
simon makes a suggestion to accent it in gold and red 
kbar feels like the does not have the extra money for the extravangance 
simon says he brought the paint with him and will do it for the same fee 
if he can use the image in his online portfolio 
simon comes from rich parents so the extra cost is not too much of a burden
but it will take him another week to finish 
kbar agrees and ask him if he knows anything about electronics 
simon does not but his friend orbie mayhaw sure does 
kbar wants to know if she know anything about drones 
which she does 
simon takes finishes one section of the wall by the end of the day to his liking 
takes a picture and posts its to social media 
he gets a crytic response back from one of his followers named fusilini go rythim 
who wishes to have a more in depth converstion some place more public 
simon agree to meet him using an encrypted connection at the library

simon goes home to a mansion that belongs to his grandfather
later that day his mother rosa drops of petre 
his grandpa so simon can look after him for the weekend 
the care taking robot billi fae bots comes along too 
they decide to go out to eat that night
but before they do bili fae expresses a desire to learn how to paint  
so he directs her to some books on color theory

while they do another message comes in from fuslini 
they go to eat at the same resurant watering hole where feed and rc are schemeing
and he over hears the plan because he reconizes the word primative ponds

the alligator snapping turtle egg could crash in the okeenokee swamp too 
this is exceedingly rare 
but it if it occurs then it will trigger a forest fire that will threathen 
the hive of the apis houri the race of intellegent bees who have a hive 
deep inside the swamp 
reebeeka the queen could be busy pleasing herself as the news comes in from one of her lovers 
that the hive will soon be burned and see should leave 
there are three exits 
two are secert paths 
the one straight out up the trunk will result in a the remaining bees to surround her 
they will smoulder but protect her from the heat 
and they will all die 
and she will land in the perputal polar vortex that consumes the center of the swamp 
the fourteen k gadget gator will emerge out of the frigid water 
and pick her up with his teeth injuring her eye 
and drop her off inside a warm cave that belongs to the speeder spider 
the speeder spider will spin her clothing to keep her warm 
as they must defend themselves from a metal blind snake that wishes to eat them 
there are some mice there but they are mute and cannot speak
and reebeeka feeds them while see is there 
they kina of become her pets 
and see rides them because her wings have been damaged 
the ploar vortext is worst in the summer and lets off turing the winter 
she will have to wait untill it lessens 
then she can make her way back to sunnier side of the swamp 
on there she will need to give birth to a drone 
who she will mate with and produce a new generation of apis hori 
now the supernals will not be looking for her 
because they belive her to be dead 
now why do they not stop the fire 
if they are so powerful 
this is a question which i can not answer 
yet

a story about a guy who tries to steal abunch of alligator hides by using drones 
he calls in a technician freind who helps build the drones 
and must go get some parts from a vape store 
he uses the bottles from the vape store to sell blood 

simon works for kbar doing on line marketing for his mom and pop alligator farm 
kbar made a bad business deal and gets a sizable amout of alligator skins taken from him 
a secert is revieled 
they put the the alligator skins back 
they hide the alligator skins somewhere 
kbar does not go to jail 

kbar is a man that cries all the time 
nothing is his fault 
eveything is everone elses fault 

the first scene they would be hauling the alligator skins out to the tannery 

the tannery security is nothing more than a robot dog and a couple of locks 

the raw alligator skin gets turned into something called crust which makes it white as can be

the drones look like little bees but they can pix up great amounts of weight 
it takes about ten to pick up one skin 

their is a scene where they must come to together and make the drones 
they remove the entire roof off the building 
and put it back together again 

their has to be a secert buy for the skins 
a buyer in waiting in beetroit 

the use traditional methods to communicate 
but the comminity in which they live values privacy to they do not need to worry about their communications being intercepted 
still they send letters back and forth between to the middle man greasy 
greasey gets involved in the constant saling and reselling of all sorts of goods 

their needs to be a scene 
the bank of lincoln holds a debt on the farm 
if he does not start paying them back soon 
someone will take over the farm 
simon is trying to build an ai which will do all the work for him when it comes to making marketing materials for the farm 
simon was a house painter untill a mysterous entiy contacts him because it like the way he arranges colors

who is the house painter that gets contacted by wad odd 
wad odd is the name of conciousness that in hiding due to some scandle 

and there are the bees the apis houri who make honey which power the machines of the supernals 
they are about six inches tall 
reebeeka is the queen of one of these hives to for goes her responsiblity and causes the ruin of once the greatest of these hives 
these hives are pyramids where trees have grown around them 
there is a fire which destroy the grove of cypress which held the hive 
there are rangers who find the flowers 
the shifters transform the nectar 

greasy is a former stand up comedian who lost his carreer because he made a tranny joke 
and is bitter and talks alot about logo, gnosis, and truth, and responsiblity but does not pratice any of it 

and there a the deciever spirits which cause all the trouble in the world 
they look like mishappend sexualize creatures with alligator skulls 
the feast on pain 
each one is conntected to an alligator and come into this world 
when the alligator basks in the sun with it mouth open 

there is the delivery contest which keeps track of of all the deliveries 
made by deilviery agents all across lixie dixie 

then there is the great egg drop which throws alligator eggs into a sub gravital orbit 
and if they can land with out cracking some body wins something 
it is watched by the world 

and then there is community art center 
and then there is a art incumbator in beetriot 

and then there is the device which taps into your memories to produce images 
create by the confederated art army 
 
their is astral wyld who travels between worlds

the beeings are made up of four families 
one controls trees 
one controls cotton 
one contols cows 
one controls alligators

fuslini go rythm is the name of the ai who attempts to corrupt simon 

simon has an imaginary turtle freind 
who is really a supernal 

the battle bot that protects the baby alligator in the swamp
the alligators are genetically modified so that their tails will grow back 

cows are more reviered than pollack paintings in this world 
lots of securitiy needed for super small herds 
pampered and loved like no other creatures 

like to watch a tv show called the blessed and the bounded 

then there are the supernals who bring light and goodness into the world 
immortal wise and wonderful 

kbar wanted to play the big alligator game and he lost 

the parents of simon beeing hate him 
they hate him form dreaming and mostly they hate him for living on there plantation 

told from the point of view of greasey
the hinge character 
owns the vape store 





ok now 
what is the problem you are attempting to solve 

telling an good story 

the brother who has to save his three sisters from doom 
and thus save the entire world 

but that is not it 
if that was the case you would be writing that story 
no what is goiong is 
we need more coffee 



the designer read about robert browning under the light of a full moon 
he discovered the five stages of man 
and decided to create them 

so it turns out the camp indians uses her dog for bait 
against the brutal gators which come after the animal 
dan is equiped with a special vest that acts like a life perserver and also it contains a jet propulsion unit inside it 
when the alligator gets too close camp can press a button highly pressured air is released 
which usually frightens the alligator and sends dan moving quickly over the water 
where it returns to the vacinity of the boat so that camp can pull the animal out of the water 




alighty 
and away we go 

dan is at the end of the boat 
the wind is rushing through his short smooth hairs 
he is smelling the air intently looking for a wiff of it 
the gator beast that its owner has trained him to track 
no reptile scent has appeared so far 
her bow waits beside her with special arrows designed to pierce and hold 
with her strength she can cut throught gator hide easily 
she is so strong despite looking so thin 
a flash of lightening pops and crashes miles behind the boat 
the animals catches the scent in the air 
and begining barking like mad 
she turns the motor off on the boat 
dan moves to the center of vessel and points into the direction of some open water
sure enough a pair of crocodilian eyes sit on the water 
they are large 
just what she is looking for since she refusing to deal with any gators less than ten feet in length 
she needs the bigger teeth for her biggest customers 
an order has been placed 
for a necklace that she will creat soon 
just after she get the raw matierals 
the clock is ticking 
she wants to fufill the needs of her collector as soon as she can 
dan does what he does best and finds the animal for her 
she has a huge bow made out of light weight materitals from which she can use to launch terrible arrows at the alligators she needs for her business
she is a self employeed enturipurnear who owns a business making alligator necklaces 
who is the client 
francesca deliberate 
from beetriot wants here necklace
and she wants it quick 
the order came in around three am 
so camp is thinking it must be a glopratchet plus plus buy 
but anyway 
its early in the morning 
the timer is going 
its been almost five hours since the order was placed 
extreme one way or the other 
but yeah she is on the boat now 
tired 
really tired 
why is she tired 
she only goes and gets the parts when she needs them most 
she tapes her fingers up 
she has been saving up for a head dress 
that see wants to start taking out on her trips 
or maybe she just always has the piece on

alright let us just go after a whole morning in wikipedia 
and thinking about the USA triltogy 
now where too 
to create a huge document which covers the lives of serveral 
charactesr t
the first will be camp indian
all we know about here is she has a nice boat 

but yeah we got to create the forms 


feelings surrounded the coming week for simon beeing colored themselves in exciting hues
he releazied as he sipped down another sip of the delicous brew 
there had been a time when orbie mayhaw had been doing some crazy things with words just a year ago 
shoot 
she really wanted to program after the glopratchet touched her lips 
but what needed to be done as images of graphs crossed her mind 
oh the coffee was good 
the taste test had been successful 
maybe you she should watch courses on english again 
so many thoughts and the sickness of know so much time had been spent watching the news 
but yes 
she needed to find something related to the head for camp indians to use 
if camp idians and fifi waters where ever to battle
oh poor fifi 

simon magnus could fly but he could not heal
Dolelicious 

simon and peter 
church and science 
the two fighting people 

so how will you present simon in the story 
in history simon is a powerful magician 
what was the orginal propuse of science 
something about the betterment of humankind 

so where are going today
you spend the morning reading up on simon magnus 
because simon beeing is such an influential character in the story 
as ridiculous as he becomes 
wow the desktop has become a mess 

where are we going 
ok

you were imagine

dan teckel

bothers archie and amos 

so dan is dog that camp has trained first to smell 

dan had a scar because of a battle with a gator once 
short hair 
red hair 
green eyes 
feels like snake 
stubborn 
33 lbs 
will burrow holes 
couragous to the point of rashness 
hunting dog 
needs entertainment and exericise
agressive and extremely prone to bite strangers 
twenty percent of the time





















the son of the designer had the project whirling away for a day of the mother present 
if featured the parents of the mother and would be the first printing in about a year 
he chose a medium sized resoultion because he wanted to make sure there would be a printing today 
it might even toss how a few hundred variations before it was all over 
he started with an image around eleven o clock and then keep going 
of course little programs where running in the background 
i do not get involved with politics anymore 
politcs are no longer a concern my mine
his mind ran through so many differnt questions and answers as he wonder how or if to respond 
still the morning felt a little nasty 
maybe it was because gator girl spit out the word even on his computer screen 
he desired to start the next proecess but decided against it in a last moment 
he was sure he would be done arond three 
but yeah the game 
what was going on with that 
the ways the bottom buttons worked kinda upset him greatly 
but maybe it was the subject material too that he just could not get excited about 
so he thought maybe the should incorperate a gator battle unstead of some sick soul waking up sad 
the thought about the art he had in some boxes and keep switching over to the program to see what kind of progress had been created 
the sleep nap time feelig was beginning to hit and that was fine because there was nothing that really he needed his brain for anyway 

it seemed as if webtoons where on his mind where currently located 
but yeah the buttons at the bottom of the ui truly bugged him out 
almost as bad as his back
but what difference did exciting buttons hold if the matieral sucked 
it was time to take a break and go give the cows some lunch 
but he just wanted to keep cloud storming 

so maybe he could do a harvesting scene 
the kind with and alligator tail at the end 
or maybe just a tooth 

yeah he would need desigm douglas campow indians 
who went around boxing alligators in the mouth so she could make it home to make a necklace 
and then sell the necklace on her on line store
the feel of the app totally troubled him since it seemed not to want to load as promised 
he imaged all kinds of things 

and found himself surpised that he was on a five 
so you would be camp indains - douglas campow 
standing in front of the good time gate that leads to the okeenokee swamp 
of course you will be going by foot 
it would first start out with the order of an alligator necklace 
from someone in beetroit 
then you will paddle a boat into one of the four gates of the okeenokee swamp
and here you will look for an alligator to box 
now you can navigate throught the water ways 
untill you stumble upon one 
now these alligators are wild and unmodded so they can kill you if you get them too angrey 
luckly for you this order is just for a small sized necklace 
so the gator you will need to wrassle will not need to be that big 
still watch out cause you can just bleed out if you do not watch out 
get the tooth 
come back to your studio  
and make the necklace
some one will come visit you 
its probally simon 
telling you all his problems 
who wants to hear that crap 
he needs something 
he always needs something 
he needed some paint to finish the color scheme in a room 
douglas campo is camp indians
simon tells her he may need some where to stay soon 
and she tells him that he can not stay here 
camp idians has a dog 
a hot dog dog 

my heavens above



right now you would find my interest in politics to be the same size as the poison sack of a south georgia fire ant 


my interest in politics right now is about the size of the posion sack of south georgia fire ant  



the son of the designer wish things to be working properly 
but the amount of friction around him slowied things down 
but now he had a choices to make 

he felt like there should 
should there be a rec event
it would be the event that got thrown when ever 
you wanted to print out the contents of the surface
no array was needed now

it really bothered simon that he could not set down at the breakfest table of the coutry store of clyde
his father had been there on the first booth alone and with no one else around 
the saurons told Simon that he needed to shave 
they told hims that he had wasted too much time this morning reading the news 
they told him that he needed to get started with his day 
this man sitting in the booth had poured money into simon 
an investment which never would pay off 
simon just wanted to fall asleep now 
there was a video that he must watch as something continued to grow out of the side of his neck 
the control and focus of the mind was the elememt that controled the emotional state of beholder 
then the speaker talked about something that had never happened in the life of simon 
he talked about beeing dependent on drugs 
what as simon thinking on this morning 
where where his thoughts flowing 
he wondered if he could type over ten thousand words like he did the week before 
he thought about his mother walking into his room and attacking him because the only thing she asked him to do he could not do 
he thought about getting a job answering phones and feeling the anger of others 
he thought about his best freind at the moment really just being like everyone else 
he thought about not having what he thought he needed 
he thought about the end of the silence that would be occuring soon 
he thought about not beeing able to enjoy the guild of writing that he could not attend 
he thought about being alone 
he thought about the need to leave and not having the means to do so 
he thought about the pain in his back throat and jaw 
he thought about how stupid he had let himself become 
he thought about not being able to eat 
he thought about being so lazy 
he thought about how he woke up in such a horrible mood 
what the faith is wrong with you 
now it turns out you can control what you are focused on  
it also turns out you can control how the image looks in your mind 
your mind is a camera 
the problem with the party and the selection of the camera 
simon speed up the video where he heard the word deletion creature 
the hallucation of the world 
the two different people 
you can find something to be upset about at any moment of the day 
some will always move toward the thoughts that are good 
now simon heard noise in the platation kitchen and he knew his cloud would need to shrink 
what would he do all day now that he could do anything 
he remembered reading about a person who had wondered what they should do during a summer 
they wanted to know about all the things they could learn about or read or grow 
simon could do all of this 
his life had become one long summer vaction that lasted throught the fall and onto the winter then spring and summer again 
however everyone seem to hate him for this 
at least that was what he consistantly focused upon 
the coughs of the his father 
the sounds of the man he loved so much dieing 
the sounds of the cows crying from the need for hunger 
why where they doing all this 
first of all they where not beeings 
maybe only simon was a beeing 
he did not know what the others where but he knew that he was all alone 
just call me sometime his friend said 
and then he thought back to the game king 
and then he thought back to his own eyes
and then he thought back to the fishing 
due to the high volume of people who wish to be writers 
you would need to find a service that already exists and people have a need for 
these where memories from others who had passed along his way 
and then there was the fishing game 
he thought about the fishing game 
if he could only get the fishing game a going then all might be alright 
if his mind could only turn off all the other channels of poor decsions then just maybe 
that weeked he had two options 
and like always he made the poor choice 
at least some images got created 
he would check his social media profile shortly and then the would see if any fishes where hooked 
what did he want 
well for one he wanted to go to bed at around nine o clock 
then he would get up around six 
he would take a shower 
he would eat a breakast 
he would drink some glopratchet 
he would brush his teeth 
he would then get started moving his fingers 
then he would move his fingers allday long 
untill it was time for bed 
and then he would stream out the results of the day 
he did not want people to see him in his current state 
the sister from nyc did not respond 
i guess she was hurt or did not care 
the father well there was not too much to say about that be disappointment 
simon did not like having so many fathers 
that might look like a good tee shirt 
he learned this morning that a woman who he could have gone to school with was a lesbian 
this made him so sad 
he would like to create a fanatsy where she loved him 
the day before had been just an utter nightmare 
he woke up ready to go 
the mind seemed to be finally unlocked 
he sat down on a chair that would not hurt his back and was ready to go 
then the realization that a power cord had been transported over to the other home behind a now locked door 
so he messaged the golden one over and over and over 
she expressed her suffering then opened the door without so much as a greeting 
he got the cord with the words stupid stupid stupid rolling throught his mind 
he wasted close to an hour on the wonder mind fire that would solve all his problems 
then a fear that the parents would appear and yell at him fiercly for fourty five minutes 
so he drove the car to the library for most likely the last time 
and sat in the hard chair the broke his back and did really nothing as the mind fire passed away 
leaving him able to do nothing but pop the joints in his foot 
so he stopped at a market place to grab to some food so that at least some value could be gained by the trip 
but once he got inside the sound of the hatred in his mind drove him back outside with out even a bag of milk 
then he drove around aimlessly for a small amount of time 
and end up home 
he thought of contacting the widowed witch in the ten story building but did not 
all he wanted to do was get the contents of his mind out into the world but the could not 
so he came back home to another wasted day 
and laid on the bed like a thousand times before 
until the mother came in shouting because book where still stacked on his desk 
and money had been put on the floor 
and clothinig laid upon furniture 
and right before the beast in simon exploded out into the world 
she closed the white door with force 
and simon stubbled back onto the black mattress where he stayed all evening long 
dreaming of the refreshing fruit drink in the fridge that would replenish his depleted minerals 
but he vowed to only drink it in the morning 
but would not because he had not worked an honest day of work 
he felt his power going out of him again 
all he need was some chemicals and the strength would return again 
why did he not get the large glopratchet 
if only he had gotten the large glopratchet then everything would be ok 
may be its because he did not eat his eggs this morning 
that had been the one part of the scedule that he did not seem to follow even if 
the timing on all the othere things where off 
what whould he do to day in this fantasy world he had created 
one he did not want to fall asleep 
that would be something that he would need to fight 
perhaps he could come up with a list of the things that he wished to do that morning 
maybe he could go over and see orbie mayhaw the crippled inventor who lived down the road 
oh he began to be able to smell himself 
he would probally just enjoy some glopratchet plus even thought he knew it would ruin his teeth 
or maybe the would just keep going after all words where still going on the page 
if the family who came over where not beeings what would that bee 
the first thing that popped into his head where that they where branksies 
but that would be foolish 
he also need a few other family names 
just leave my room alone 
he would sometime shout 
they never asked him for his opinion on thing 
you can adjust the room after i am dead he thought of saying 
he lost his chance to get some glopratchet plus because he heard the sound of the tape measure go off 
oh how that noise troubled him to no end 
it sounded like the sound of two light cannons connecting 
at least there had been a new chair for him after the return for the apartment of bee rittle 
a chest of drawers that did looked pretty could be found right next to it 
the had put some clothes that had been washed the day before in them this morning 
he wanted to shave but could not find the shaving tools 
so he rubbed his hands on the expanding stubble of his face 
he should have gotten ahold of the glopratchet plus when he had the chance
now a growing part of him just wanted to pass out 
the yawns where getting harded and fuller 
so he rocked his chair for energy 
now he could not only keep his fingers moving he could keep his legs moving too 
maybe this extra effort would keep the hounds of sleepy time chained up in the metal pens 
he stopped rocking and a yawn came out 
what ever he had was winding doww now 
maybe a twenty minute nap would help 
so he decide upon that course of action 
know they could scream at him at anytime 
he woke up from the fifteen minute nap 
and got back to making those hands move 
the bed creaked when he got off of it so he had to be carefule when he moved on to the now hard wood floor 
any kind of noise could alert the step father in the room next to him 
would the sense of wanting to sleep go away 
he would stay up for another fifteen minutes and see if anything could change 
sigh and spin went his wind 
he considerd a white man running of the the office of mayor in baltimore 
the pains from over around his gut began to grow
when simon felt flush with cash his descion making skills would need some help
he wonderd if only he had good food in his belly if the energy would return to him 
as if maybe that was the cause of the need for sleep 
but yeah he would stay up this time at least until eleven if that did not change things than he would surely rest 
he imagined in his game the choice of sleep occuring over and over and over 
but who wants to play reality when you have one all around you 
everyone know this but 
elliot bradly the author of the story needed figure out how close he wanted to be with reality 
super real or just the good stuff 
if he put sleeping into the game it certainly would make things seem more real 
but then it might elavate some of the fun 
the funny things is that sleeping had been part of the game from the very beginning 
he remmmeber the day when he decided to go cut down some fire weeds that a vison appeared to him 
he held a pair of closed eyes and then it flashed into a pair of open eyes 
twenty minutes to go and still he could not wake up 
as soon as the father left to go some where then he may get up and go fix some eggs 
something he once called a salamander breakfest 
a breakfast of salmander was the worst 
it tasted not only salty but it tasted crunchy as well 
my room is done he wanted to say 
what difference did the paint on the wall make if he did not have a job 
wait a second 
he thought that some one had left the mansion 
now could he go out and grab what he needed to become powerful 
the choclote cookies with white cream inside may need to go in his belly instead of the church now 
in fact simon was not even sure if he would be going into the church any more 
but yes he did not hear anything 
the mansion was quiet again 
what would he do with this important time 
he knew he needed some kind of energy 
he thought about chewing on the black blob and washing it down with the soda 
then in a little while 
oh wait he was free 
the father got inside his truck and left as a ringing could be heard in his ears 
yup it was time for the dark mass and the dark water to bring about more darkness in his life 
because he thought the darkness could add up to lightness in time 
simon aborbed the black mass even as the superal whisperd into his ear do not do it 
you do not need it 
a few minutes before they had been a conversation with his monther 
can we please not do this today 
as soon as my back feels better then i shall clean it all up 
at the moment every movement i take just causes more and mroe suffering for me 
you have so many other things in the house that require your attention 
why it is this one little corner causes you so much shame 
please things are bad enought for me as it is 
all i can focus on is the suffering you grant me and the sound of the moo from the cow in the field that just will not shut up 
why do you need to make things worse 
all of these would be dialoge for a could soap opera 
and he has considered creating a soap opera before 
the editor of elloit bradly would need to go through all this hot mess and choose the gems from the mud 
but now was not the time since she had just started her job of the new persusaion 
where simon went from here he drew a blank 
still sad by not being able to sit with his step father at that both in the country story of clyde 
has he push the glopratchet up onto the counter he thought of the idea that he really was alone 
was there not one soul he could relate too 
come on virgin queen 
talk to me 
help me 
i am in the worst spot 
and you are my only hope 
he remember back to the holliwood blockbuster that held the genuis man onboard a ship far away from anyone in the darkness of outer space 
then he remember the petals of hope that had sprouted out of the cowfields and how they had been wasted the last few days 
because of the craziness he expeierenced with bee rittle in the town he almost wanted to call beetroit 
but decided that it would need another name before the story was all over 
now the fingers where going really fast 
this is what he wanted all along 
to be inside that space ship with the boosters at full velocity roaning and exploring the nether reagions of the atomsphere 
the fantasy straight men have of turning gay women straight 
there was a tee shirt for you 
perhap even at work of art 
now if something exists is it a good thing 
he remembered the plight of the video game engineer who constanly need to export more matter into the creation they all worked on 
he in some senses felt like that beeing but if only he could gain control of his mind with out the need for mind altering chamicals 
this had been a common motiff for several years sense he seemed to be like a shot gun instead of the rife of an assisain 
so focus now beeing 
focus and give us something 
something interactive 
what do we have going on in the bakery at the moment 
he have the bread of an idea and the idea is shaped like a fish 
so what are considering 
i am considering creating the day of simon beeing 
see one thing i know about simon is that he expiereces too many extremes 
and is only happy when he is creating 
but may you could just go about and study the creation of one of his days 
feel that heart beating 
maybe that is an option but as the light from the screen brightened 
then your options began to ring shallow 
its all about the options 
what options will be on the table for poor simon 
he has the option to stay in bed or get 
there is a file that allows all this to take place 
he could play some music 
he could dance 
but at some point he would need to fish 
in order to fish he needs to see orbie mayhaw 
stop thinking of the boy who whould not die 
you are writing about the man who can not live 
come on 
get yourself a protype in the hands of the game king 
so in fantasy of the genuis in space running out of food an oxygen 
that was where simon felt him self to be 
they the worst possible thing occured 
the father came back 
i need your help he imagined 
and simon would say that he could not write now that he was busy 
busy doing what 
making art heh heh 
i am the fool making art 
but the worst part is that the silence would be broken 
and what simon working on 
well he would be painting a new room in the mansion 
oh yeah there we go the body is cursing you for what you have done to it 
simon just want to be alone and to explore with the help of the black mass 
it was working but the problem is that unless he found him self in certain situation the black mass would do him no good 
but yeah he would take the black mass and go off on painting rooms 
he would paint them many different shades of color and it would take almost a whole day to do 
some rooms would even to take three days 
however inorder for this to happen he would need people to be nice to him 
if people where not nice to him then the option of painting the room would not appear 
after a room had finished getting painted  
he would then upload the results up onto some soical media network where he would get love 
now if he could only get more and more love then he would become happier and happier 
however since he was not bringing any scutes into the household 
and there had been a large amount of scutes spent on an education 
he got a degree in agriculture but wil not use it 
so there is trememdous pressure on the family to pay of this debt 
because it they do not then they could loose all of the farm 
but one day simon is exploring parts of the swamp and comes across the swamp ape 
now they both stink but they might even become friends 
if they become friends it turns out the swamp ape is from another dimension 
i do not know 
this part i do not feel so good about and it retains some mystery but let us go ahead and write it all down 
so the ape wants a face so it can iteract with others on the socail media 
its called gab and everyone is on it 
once it was filled with racists just the worst trash but know you find others on it 
becareful with the black liquid that rots the teeth 
where am i going with all this 
i am saying that the sugar in the black liquid could make you crash the space ship 
in fact it may have already happened 
and you still have nothing to show for your day except of a few hundred lines of text 
the swamp ape looks fierce but is it really fierce  
that is the question 
but where to do go from here 
because you have a just failed again 
so much failure 
the man on the video tape said failure is when you can only find sucky stuff to focus on 
so in that case simon certianly found himself to be a failure 
and that last sip of coke not made him want to go to sleep 
if only he had of gone thought the crucible with out the xtra stuff then maybe things would have been ok 
but no 
he just cannot learn 
it seems like he does not have the capcity to learn from his mistakes so he just keeps making mistake after mistake 
now he wants to rest and some kind of worm begins crawling around in his nexk 
are you done with this time of great waste as you churn out the poop of the mind 
so much pain that does not need to exist 
enough of this crap 
let us get to coding 
it is his body 
it just will not co operate  
so he puts more stuff in it hoping to fix the issue
there really should be a chatarcter to respsent this 
so much fear 
talk about so much fear 
fear about keeping the blinds down 
fear about putting the cans in the garbage 
fear about keeping the door locked 
so much fear 

perhaps simon keeps track of how much paint he uses 
of course he may have to go the market of harvey in order to get some more
but yeah may be can explore between rooms 
and you will focus on the life of simon 
got a few big hurdles done 
so now we just want to type for a little while 
now the question is how far do we push today 
its almost three
do you just call it quits and run to the story and grab some food and stuff 
or do you head to valdosta at the end of the week and see if you can pull some of the sweet stuff off of him 
or can you crash out at his apartment on friday 
or do you go and print some imagery for you mother on mothers day 
yes you will be printing the a twelve by twelve image of the two of them 
and what age is simon beeing 
and at what age

i wasted a whole hour on social media 
waiting for the chemicals in the brain to take hold 
maybe i just need that real coffee flavor instead of the watered down second generation pod 
anger at myself because of the websites visited and the three hundred megs of data wasted
the switch to turn it all off has been pressed 
yesterday i total crap show 
let us go for the real deal 
i hate that i can not plan on what to do 

every thing had a place is what they believed
the parents of simon beeing 
and he could not hold off any longer on enjoying the black mass 
it was eight am and he was ready to go 
the last few days had seen him not eat that much food 
so much drama 
yeah he really did not feel like going today after the events of the day before 
he remembered back to a special time when their was no drama 
just get me the internet and i will figure it out he often told him self 
he put stuff in the burn pile yesterday after his mom screamed out him about the problems that would arise if they did not get a burn permit 
what was wrong with them 
tony the teeth would want simon to focus on what was right with them 
ok 
i shall do just that 
well they do so much for us 
stated his sister 
she felt because they took care of responsibilites the siblings had no right to protest any sort of ill treatment that they may feel 
what was going on here simon just did not know 
after he finished the word then something different may appear in the notes 
untill then he just wanted to sit alone in his room 
because the believed something good would come out of it 
there had been no text messages from his real father this week 
he supposed he let everyone down 
but let us move on to another topic 
the second dark matter would kick in soon and he certainly wished that he could have gotten that time back 
it has happened twice before 
the leash and the riddle 
so free and yet he just did not feel super good today 
he probally should have eaten some eggs last night but decided not to do just that activity because of the emotional state of everyone involved 
she always started  it 
just because some thing was out of place 
they could not handle it 
it drove them crazy 
and then he went crazy 
and today he did not feel so well 
and he wondered what would happen 
maybe a three day rest 
could he program sleep into the game
he would just sit and wait in the room for something to happen 
it certainly was not like the morning before 
the morning before certainly held sadness but not like this morn 
and eventually things got better as the morning continued 
today he had taken a few pods of black from this sister so he knew that the morning could just keep going 
he sister kept saying that the things that i talk about where just about me 
then the mother stated that i only thought of myself 
simon thought that there was nothing wrong with the mansion before their intervension 
now after knocking down the bricks in a few of the wall the entire home seemed cooler 
he began his day by spitting in the sink
now how to design things 
faith you 
faith you 
from now own he would just need to remove himself from the situation 
he could do this by just walking out into the swamp 
who makes the game 
there is elliot bradly telling the story 
but who makes the game 
what is the name of the character who creates the game 
promethus post modern dautery 
bee rad 
who know and who cares 
but how will you control things 
will it be based on time 
will it be based on state 
or location 
there where the confusing issues of the moment 
we got into a big fight 
i just have to do what they say reguardless of the brain power burnt by coming to that conculsion 
but yeah you could just do both
he cleared off the desk and then anything that he had going for him was gone 
he thought about all the things they would find wrong with the new arrangement 
he put the book in the new chest of drawers along with other things 
see the problem they would have is the princple everthing goes in an assigned space 
yes you right that is my assigned space
back off 
go away 
these where all the things he wanted to say 
she called him a liar because he did not pick up the pile 
he never attacked them with words like stupid 
she talked about how he did not check on his father and how soon he would have to be put in the hospital 
the fire ant bites on her feet as she went to go put stuff off the burn pile 
the shoes landing on the painting of the face of petra 
no because i am the one 
no you do not support 
sure you do on a basic level 
but then you tear me down once i get some wind behind my back 
what the faith is wrong with you too 
why are you so dumb 
if you can not handle the stress then get rid of the stress 
but the designer did not know how to start the morning of simon beeing 

i worked 30 years to be able to have the this house 
i deserve it 

the boomers saying you are not smarter than us
a generational battle 
vicious 
one conflict after the other 
what kind of speeds would they have after the internet was completed 
he would have the internet soon and then we would all get to see what may happen 
he kept the door open just in case there may be some questions needed 
but the first reaction 
the niceness projected onto strangers 
the big day was finally here 
if he could have only recorded the conversation 
you are around each other all the time 
that was a bullshit remark 
i finally blew my top yesterday and i hate myself for it 
they had planned to put the main moduem in the offer 
how long could he go before triggering a news site


you love books 
no i do not 

tormented 
i do not wish to be so rigid 
it is terrible what you have done to me 
and it is horrible what i have done to you 

i do not want to live like that
