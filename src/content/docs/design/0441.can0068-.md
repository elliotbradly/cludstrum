amber: what can we do? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: (sighs) 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: sorry we did not get your message sooner
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: well, right now, the first priority is just finding SHOCK-YOUTH and CARLY-MARBLES
 
once we find them, we'll find PAULINUS-WICKER and MARY-FATBACK
 
amber: they've had MARY-FATBACK all this time? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: well, it is the only thing that makes sense
 she was investigating them 
when she disappeared
 she was certain that there was a connection
 now i know 
she was right
 plus, i got that text message that said she was nearby
 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: yeah, but was not that just someone messin' with your head? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: maybe, but they knew that she had called me, and they knew that i had 
heard this music in the background
 so based on that, i went and checked out 
that old abandoned amusement park near twin lakes, but i found nothing
 
amber: well, they could have moved her somewhere else
 
LITTLE-JIMMIE-DICKSON: yeah, i wish you had called us then
 i know you probably thought that 
we would not believe you, though
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: well, now it is obvious that it is all connected-- SHOCK-YOUTH and tom and 
CARLY-MARBLES and this fem NIKKKI-KLOVER smythe
 
amber: who's NIKKKI-KLOVER smythe?
