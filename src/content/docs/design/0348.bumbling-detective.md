A subgenre in which a character makes a lot of mistakes in solving a mystery, but manages to solve it anyway. There is usually a lot of comedy involved in the process and the protagonist misses important clues, making the process of solving the crime more difficult than it should be. Often, the plot is intricate. Literary Examples: The Spellman Files: Document #1, The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie: A Flavia de Luce Mystery, Heat Wave
