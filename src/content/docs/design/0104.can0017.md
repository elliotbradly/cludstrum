Emily: Jack, I know how upset you are that Tucker McCall is taking over 
Chancellor and Jabot
 
Jack: (Sighs) 
Emily: I-I-I would have expected that this wedding planning day would have 
taken a backseat
 
Jack: No, that was my previous M
O
 when I pushed my personal life aside all 
the time
 That's why when you met me, I didn't have much of a personal life
 No, 
I'm putting things in a little more perspective now
 
Emily: Well, your future children and I are very grateful
 
Jack: Yeah? 
 
Emily: Yes
 Mm
 
Chloe: Hi, guys
 
Emily: Oh
 
Chloe: Sorry I'm late
 
Jack: (Sighs) 
Chloe: Huge emergency
 
Jack: Oh? 
 
Emily: Wha--uh, with the wedding? 
 
Chloe: Oh
 Just a broken water main at the church
 The entire roof caved in


Jack: What? 
 
Chloe: Yeah
 But I got it covered
 
Emily: Okay
 
Chloe: Actually, they referred me to Father McMillan at Sacred Heart, and 
they can fit us in
 
Emily: They have Valentineï¿½s Day available? 
 
Chloe: Yes
 They just got a cancellation, and, look, it's a beautiful church
 
It's very traditional
 I'm sure you've been there for weddings and such
 
Jack: Yeah
 Yeah, I have
 
Chloe: Great
 
Emily: Well, I'm--I'm so relieved they have an opening
 It wouldn't feel like 
I was married if it wasn't a catholic wedding
 
Chloe: Hey, look, if your heart is set on St
 Charles, we--we can push the 
date
 Um, just probably March the earliest
 And, I mean, that's just hoping that 
the weather is gonna be okay but


 
Emily: No
 No, we don't want to wait, right? 
 
Jack: Uh, no
 Definitely not
 Hmm
 
Chloe: Okay
