now the question arises 
how does one select a point for a surface
how could one select a point 
it could be randomly 
it could be based upon value

it is made out of web pages 
it is made out of videos
it is interactive 
it is made out of cloudflare

you come to a web site 
what do you see 
a video 

of the weather 

mica metrological is telling you about the weather of the day

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

someone is in the hospital 
they have sustained injuries from wrestling an alligator 
a wife comes to comfort them 

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

troubles vist two artists 
they compete with thier wills to outlast suffering 

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

greasi holds an auction on an amazing fine art piece
if it gets bought something enters into the world  

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

catharsis removes road kill off of hot asphault 

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

machines race through loops of liquid 
a giant alligator sits in the middle wishing to harm
a quiet genius sits in the stands wondering how it all works 

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

hexagrams sort themselves into pattern
a middle age man walks on dirty path 

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

the scene of a market in astrokhan  
values of hues are bought and sold using ethereum 
as these records change the perfect beeing expierence changes as well

code compels the focus into motion 
time moves forward 

another scene of a painter in astrokahn
spectrums out a league of possibilities

now how does one select a point for a surface
show me the ways 
it could be completely randomly 
an escaliting value 
a descreasing value 
a heirarchy of points 
select the head of a chain and follow it out 
what exactly are you selecting 
perhaps a planet 
then some mind on the planet
an element of danger this morning 
scoring system
who is in the most danger
slave to your desires 
the game is going to be over when you reach zero.

so you have planets 
lots of them but 
you have no keyboard 
what is next 
you do have a keyboard 
but just not the kind you wanted to see 
what comes next after the planets 
so have weather too 
but that does not seem to excite you as much 
anymore 
you want alligators 
space ships 
interstellar trade
you want activities 
get up 
go to bed 
the chain 
alligators on every planet

what did you see when you went under
planets this time 
lots of planet 
all kinds of planets 
planets 
planets as an abstraction 
some hero in a foreign space counting 
trying to achieve 333 
soo hard 
fall unconious in someplaces 
torso shots of people in front of planets
dialog floating up in boxes in front of them 
keep track of celestial orbits 
an api for that info 
the fine tuning of the universe
need a way to reset the time 
autorization
how to authorize an api

so we need to get the clock up and running 
then the app can begin to pull in a time
then david can begin to breathe

what do we wish to explore next with God 

the weather 
you have a character that just shares a weather report with you 
that is the idea 

there is also the idea where an artist creates a work of beauti and is banshished 

abstractions 

the director with the white beautiful hair 
not jim jarmush 

so you have an artist 
what can an aritst be abstracted out into 
an artist itself is abstraction 

you are a farmer 
not allowed to grow beautiful cows 
but yet you have been secertly 
banished into the outer space

what are you building 
an automation
why 
because it can express the concept of time in a way 
that is original
and allows the audience to particpate in a novel way  

how does this touch the director with the beautiful white hair
