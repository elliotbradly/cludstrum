during the summer solstice of 1944 on June 21
13 erpentropes are born during the middle of the night
they come together in the little town of lickskillet to find a cure 

for every hour you log off you have a chance of turning into the erpenthrope
when you log back on you are human or erpenthrope
if erpenthrope then you must bare witness to the acts of heroics or destruction you cause

before all of these you are asked a serious of questions which determines which type of character you become
blessed or bounded
it ages you past the moment of conception 
to around twenty years of age 
its an RPG with a great lifepath system to start things up 
it roles plays through all the different scenrioes of how the different characters connect

some of the characters have jobs which are used to support the ongoing research
to help them live better lives

above it all exist T.A.S.U.S.S in control of all the various versions of the above scenerio 

we are in the office of a middle ranking analyst aboard T>A>S>U>S>S

T.A.S.S.U.S.S is an ancorn

T>A>S>U>S>S stands for TRANSITIONAL ALLIANCE something som something
he turns on a lamp with a base of organic, flowing lines taking shape 
a stiff brass motif of vines 
depictions of the tendrils and branches wrap around the lamp base and shade with a highly decorative and ornate appearance. 
The vines where once the imprint of a lost wax cast to ensure the detail needed for intricate foliage designs finished with a patina
after a pull on the tiny round links of a chain four small bulb diffuses light through the stained glass 
into a special color effect of green, red, and pearl 

he spread his papers across the desk
and lights a cigar 
the Erbar font on his computer screen spells out victory
the reptile ranch he bet on down on alligator earth has won again 


he uses these little terminal programs

the sugar content of a few of the sanctuaries had decreased 
there would need to be a few more peach drops to up those numbers
he flipped the channel over to the on containing weather data 
pull out a notepad with pencil and started recording the data of the day
there would be a meeting later in the day where he would need to interpolate his findings

when he finished the transference of the key data points of the day 
he laid down on his upholstered bench to relax to interpret the meaning behind the planets behavior
