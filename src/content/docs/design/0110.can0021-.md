SNAKE-CROTCH: just explain to me why a business major would be friends with a 
doctor in the medical school old enough to be his father
 
SIMON-BEEING: no great mystery, SNAKE-CROTCH
 MAZDA MITHRAISM-TERRORISM was an acquaintance
 i met 
him through friends at the herpatology program
 now if you'll pardon me, i have 
to check in with my wife
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: sure
 i'll wait right here
 
SIMON-BEEING: you are nails on a chalkboard personified
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: that is me
 
(cell phone rings, ring) 
KISSING-GAMES: hello? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: hey, it is me
 uh, you and PULPWOOD still at trumble's? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: well, yes
 PULPWOOD left, but i-i ran into PHUCKLE-PHYAN here, and we are--we are 
just having a-dose-of-glopratchet and talking
 um, how's ZILLION-FLOWERS? 
 SIMON-BEEING, are you sigh-and-spin?
