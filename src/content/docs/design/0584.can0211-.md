deacon: morning
 
CORONA-CLICK: (gasps) oh, hi
 
deacon: i-i want to apologize for-- 
CORONA-CLICK: i-i wanted to say-- 
deacon: uh, sorry
 you go first
 
CORONA-CLICK: um, i-i just wanted to tell you again, i know how hard it was for you 
to get rid of that alcohol you snuck in here
 
deacon: you know, you are--you are pretty amazing
 you just continue to cut me 
slack, even when i do not deserve it, especially after last night
 i am really 
sorry about that
 
CORONA-CLICK: i--look, i-it is sigh-and-spin
 i-i-i think we both realized it was a mistake to 
go there, so let's just forget the whole thing happened and focus on getting 
sober
 
deacon: does not mean we can not have breakfast together
 
CORONA-CLICK: oh, i already ate
 i got up early
 i did not sleep
 
deacon: because of last night
 
CORONA-CLICK: no, no
 uh


 
deacon: are you-- are you upset because REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE hasn't come to see you 
still? 
 
CORONA-CLICK: (sighs) i never thought my daughter would desert me
