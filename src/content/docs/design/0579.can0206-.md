REXXXX-LEXXXX: well, have you seen your mother this morning? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: uh, i am actually outside her room now
 i just have not gone in yet
 it is 
not real easy seeing my mom in a place like this
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: (sighs) you have not told anyone, have you? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: no, you asked me not to, so i have not told REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE, dad, but i am not 
comfortable with it
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: no, but wait a minute
 i want to talk to her myself, all right? 
 i 
want to break this to her in my own way
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: how soon? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: today
 i promise you, sigh-and-spin? 
 now you stick to your promise

mother i'll be by later, all right?

REXXXX-LEXXXX: (sighs) i am on the way to mediation
 
meggie: oh, well, i'll look after everything around here, and i'll make sure 
there's a hot meal waiting for you when you get back
 with so much going on, i-i 
do not want you to worry about anything around here
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: yeah, i appreciate that, meggie
 
meggie: well, how are you, REXXXX-LEXXXX, really?

REXXXX-LEXXXX: no, not much
