NIKI-BIKINI: JABO, i know how upset you are that ASTRIAL-WILD QUIESCENCE is taking over 
chancellor and REPTIQUE
 
JABO: (sighs) 
NIKI-BIKINI: i-i-i would have expected that this wedding planning day would have 
taken a backseat
 
JABO: no, that was my previous m
o
 when i pushed my personal life aside all 
the time
 that is why when you met me, i did not have much of a personal life
 no, 
i am putting things in a little more perspective now
 
NIKI-BIKINI: well, your future chilDRen and i are very grateful
 
JABO: yeah? 
 
NIKI-BIKINI: yes

JABO: (sighs) 
chloe: huge emergency
 
JABO: oh? 
 
NIKI-BIKINI: wha--uh, with the wedding? 
 
chloe: oh
 just a broken water main at the church
 the entire roof caved in


JABO: what? 
 
chloe: yeah
 but i got it covered
 
NIKI-BIKINI: sigh-and-spin
 
chloe: actually, they referred me to father mcmillan at sacred heart, and 
they can fit us in
 
NIKI-BIKINI: they have valentineï¿½s day available? 
 
chloe: yes
 they just got a cancellation, and, look, it is a beautiful church
 
it is very traditional
 i am sure you have been there for weddings and such
 
JABO: yeah
 yeah, i have
 
chloe: great
 
NIKI-BIKINI: well, i am--i am so relieved they have an opening

i was married if it was not a catholic wedding
 
chloe: hey, look, if your heart is set on st
 MAZDA, we--we can push the 
date
 um, just probably march the earliest
