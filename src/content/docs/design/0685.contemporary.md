This subgenre of fantasy is a fantasy story in a modern-day setting (or one that resembles contemporary times). 
It often contains magic but it is not obvious, or perhaps able to be explained logically. 
There is often an intersect between the "real world" and the fantastical one that includes magic or characters with paranormal abilities.

Literary Examples: American Gods, Hounded, The Raven Boys
