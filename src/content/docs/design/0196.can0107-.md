ASTRIAL-WILD: so sorry for cuttin' into your evening
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: that is sigh-and-spin
 thank you
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: it is been one meeting after another, huh? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: yeah, but, um, i am enjoying myself
 i really am
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: yeah? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: yeah
 so what is happening with beauty of nature? 
 i recall last time, 
you said you were gonna play things by the book
 are you keeping your word? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: well, you laid down the law
 i had to comply
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (laughs) 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i still want to know how BEEING has the asian market sewn up with 
mitsukoshi, though
 i think i found a legit way to get the information
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i am waiting
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i'll arrange a leak
 REXXXX-LEXXXX will learn that i am pursuing mitsukoshi 
department stores for REPTIQUE
 now i am guessing that he'll, uh, make a move to 
shore up his deal with them
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: so you think he is gonna slip up and show his hand when he feels 
threatened? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: too sneaky? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: it is sneaky
 it is definitely sneaky
 but it is not illegal, and i am 
sigh-and-spin with sneaky
 (laughs) where's the leak gonna come from though? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: BRANKSY-BRIGHT
 hell, she is so desperate for a story, she bugged our last 
meeting here
