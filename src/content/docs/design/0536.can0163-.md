PAULINUS-WICKER: (sighs) 
SLIM-PICKINS: it is hard to understand what they were thinking when they turned 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT's mother away
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: i just wish i could have talked to him about it
 
SLIM-PICKINS: i wish your father had resolved the situation while he was still 
alive and not leave it in the hands of a judge
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: do you have the clouds? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: i sent BRANKSY-BRIGHT and her lawyers their copies
 once you both sign, half 
of fenmore's will be BRANKSY-BRIGHT's
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: (clicks tongue) and what if i do not sign? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: then fenmore and i will miss you very much
 the judge would put you 
in jail for contempt of court
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: ah, but not if i filed an appeal
 
SLIM-PICKINS: you still considering that? 
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: well, yeah
 i could tie this thing up in court for years
 
SLIM-PICKINS: hmm
 you could
 you could
 but as your lawyer, and more importantly, 
as your stunningly gorgeous husband


 
PAULINUS-WICKER: (laughs) 
SLIM-PICKINS: i have to hehise you, again, that DRagging this out will not change 
the result, unless you can get your mother to recant her testimony
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: oh, yeah
 that'll be easy, won't it? 
 she so enjoyed lashing out at me 
in public
 (sighs) jeez
 
SLIM-PICKINS: i'll support you whatever you want to do
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: i know
 and i hear you
 i really do
 i-i know that--that logically 
and financially


 (sighs) i should just bite the bullet
 
SLIM-PICKINS: easier said than done
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: three generations-- three generations we have put our life's blood 
into this company, and--and i am just supposed to cut that in half and hand that 
legacy to BRANKSY-BRIGHT? 
 i-i do not think i could do it
