    G  ENERATORS
      A generator can be used to provide external power to
    equipment. Explorers, military units, and other expeditions
    use them for base camps, and they may be the only power
    supplies available for isolated habitations or anyone living
    “off the grid” (e.g., in a abandoned building). They’re also
    used as emergency power supplies.

    Fission Generators (TL9)
      Fission reactors produce power by splitting the nucleus
    of heavy fissionable elements such as uranium. The reactor
    and electric generator designs available at TL9 are much
    more compact and far less expensive than TL7-8 reactors.
    (They are still heavy, due to the shielding required.) A typi-
    cal semi-portable system fits in a truck bed, and provides
    external power for five years before maintenance and 
    refueling (50% of cost). $100,000, 1,000 lbs. LC2.

    Fusion Generators (TL10)
      When fusion reactors first appear at TL9, they are gigan-
    tic installations that require heavy radiation shielding and
    frequent maintenance. At TL10+ fusion reactors produce
    less radiation (due to the use of harder-to-ignite but more
    efficient aneutronic fusion reactions) and are significantly
    lighter.

C YBORGS
  A cyborg is a fusion of biological and machine parts.
There are two classes of cyborg:
  Partial Cyborgsare living creatures whose bodies con-
tain mechanical or electronic parts. They do not qualify for
the Machine meta-trait. Someone with an artificial heart,
bionic leg, or a neural interface implant is a partial cyborg.
These cybernetic modifications are covered in Chapter 8.
  Total Cyborgsare robot bodies that house an living
brain and (sometimes) parts of the spinal cord. Aside from
this, they are machines. A total cyborg has a computer that
controls many of its functions, but the guiding intelligence
is the biological brain. In the case of a total cyborg, 
the robot’s computer is reduced one size (e.g., a personal
computer becomes a small computer) and a cyborg brain
case inserted.

      A complete memory backup can be uncompressed in any

    This doesn’t necessarily mean the mind takes control of the

       Anything with a digital mind – AIs and mind emulations
    – can record its experiences without the need for any kind
    of sensie player, since it experiences everything in digital
    form already.
       A typical sensie program occupies about 100 GB/hour,
    recorded in standard digital media. Cost is about $10 per
    hour for mass-market entertainment sensies, but may be
    considerably more for specialized ones such as tutorials.
    Sensie-rental fees are usually about 20% of the purchase
    price.

    Sensie Editor (TL9)
       This is a software suite that someone who can play sen-
    sies (see Sensie Hardware, above) can use to edit raw senso-
    ry recordings. The user can wipe portions of a recorded
    sensie, compress time with smooth jumps, fadeouts or
    transitions, tone down sensory experiences, or splice sever-
    al recordings together. It also can be used to analyze a sen-
    sie recording to tell whether it is “raw” or edited, what kind
    of equipment was used, etc.
       Sensie editors are necessary to make commercial-
    quality sensies from raw recordings. For instance, if
    sensie superstar Selena Usagi records her latest travel
    sim “Beautiful in Bali,” and takes an hour-long walk
    down a moonlit beach before skinny-dipping in the
    warm tropical ocean with her co-star, the editor might
    condense it to the most stimulating 10 minutes. The
    quality of the sensie-editing job matters as much as the
    actual experience that generated the sensie; experienc-
    ing a poorly edited sensie can be disorienting and
    unpleasant! Electronics Operation (Media) skill is used

       This system detects and classifies electromagnetic emis-
    sions. On a successful Electronics Operation (EW) roll, this
    sensor detects radar or radio signals and reveals the dis-
    tance to each source. Signals are usually detected at twice
    their range; low-probability intercept signals are detected
    at 1.5 times their range.
       The system will also function as a laser sensor, detecting
    ladar, targeting laser, and laser comm signals that are
    beamed directly at it.
       The brief warning the ESM system provides gives a +1
    bonus to Dodge any attack aimed with an active targeting
    sensor that the ESM can detect.

Sensor Gloves (TL10)
  These gloves are equipped with sensitive tactile, pres-
sure, chemical, and biometric sensors. They can weigh
items by lifting them, measure the hardness and smooth-
ness of materials, detect chemicals, read ink printing, and
scan any of this information into computer memory by
touch. The user’s fingertips can sense residual heat in a
chair, or feel faint vibrations in the floor as someone
approaches. Add +4 to any task using the sense of touch;
e.g., a Forensics roll to note the similarities or differences
between two pieces of fabric, or a Search roll to feel out
tiny concealed objects.
  At higher TLs, the gloves are more sensitive: add +2 at
TL11, or +4 at TL12. They can be built into armor or suit
gloves. The bonuses from Sensor Gloves are not cumulative
with bonuses from the Acute Touch or Sensitive Touch

    Microwave Area Denial (MAD) (TL9)
        These “pain beam” weapons use microwaves to heat the
    surface of the target’s skin to about 130ºF, activating pain
    receptors without causing actual burning. The sensation is
    similar to touching a hot light bulb all over the surface of
    the body. MAD weapons are often used for riot control: they
    can disperse a crowd without leaving piles of unconscious
    bodies or messy clouds of gas.
        MAD beams deliver a HT-based affliction attack (modi-
    fier varying by weapon) with no armor divisor; add the 
    target’s DR to HT to resist. If he fails to resist, he suffers
    from the Agony affliction (p. B428) for as long as he is in
    the beam, and for one second afterward.
        MAD beams are ranged cone attacks – see  Area and
    Spreading Attacks(p.  B413). Due to the need for a large
    antenna to focus the beam, the projectors are vehicle or 
    tripod-mounted.

    Force Beams (TL10^)
       These tightly focused pressor beams (p.  88) deliver a
    kinetic impact that can knock a person down or break
    bones. Unlike sonic stunners or electrolasers, they can
    affect targets in vacuum and inflict blunt trauma even
    through heavy armor. They’re also favored by super-gad-
    geteers, since they’re no more lethal than a powerful punch.
       Force beams inflict crushing damage with the double
    knockback modifier. The beams are silent and invisible.
    Kinetic Stun Setting (TL10^)
       Any force beam can fire a kinetic stun setting that
    spreads the beam over a wider impact point.
       On “stun” the beam has no wounding effect (no HP are
    lost). It has its usual double knockback modifier, and can
    still inflict blunt trauma and knockback.

       Graviton beams are focused on a discrete point in
    space rather than affecting everything in the beam’s
    path.
       Graviton beams inflict crushing damage with the No
    Knockback damage modifier. Although their damage is
    low, they are a cosmic attack that ignores all normal
    DR. Force screens protect against them, but do so at
    1/100 of normal DR.

    Graviton Beam Weapons
       Graviton Beamer (TL11^): A pocket-sized holdout
    weapon. It has limited lethality, but can reach through the
    heaviest armor to grind bones and squeeze organs. It is
    sometimes used as a torture device.
       Graviton Cannon(TL11^): Also called an “implosion
    beam.” A single shot can reduce a man to a walnut-sized
    sphere, or crush a spaceship’s insides one compartment at
    a time!

    destroy a man-sized target in a second. Denser materials
    take a bit longer to flash out of existence, but the hardness
    doesn’t matter.
       Disintegrators use a narrow focusing beam, but the
    disintegration effect can encompass a larger area, and
    may be selectively specified at the moment of firing. A
    shot can disintegrate a person without affecting the floor
    he’s standing on, or vaporize someone’s weapon, or even
    take out two people standing together. This is an area
    effect attack (p. B413) with the Selective Area (p. B108)
    enhancement.
       Disintegrators inflict corrosion damage with a cosmic
    armor divisor (∞) that ignores DR, except for force screens
    (p. 190) and stasis webs (p. 193). Force screens protect with
    1/10 of normal DR; stasis webs completely block them.
    Anyone reduced to -10¥HP or less is disintegrated; other-
    wise, the beam bores a hole into or through the victim.
    They inflict large-area injury (p. B400); unless noted other-
    wise, they can focus on a one-yard radius.
       Disintegrators require tremendous amounts of energy,
    and use cosmic power cells (p. 19).

    Weapons
       Disintegrator Pistol(TL12^): Perhaps the ultimate hand-
    gun, this weapon fires a beam that can obliterate a man.
       Disintegrator Rifle(TL12^): This rifle can destroy a light
    armored vehicle in a single shot, or completely disintegrate
    smaller targets such as people.
       Heavy Disintegrator Cannon (TL12^): This terrifying
    weapon may be the main armament of TL12^ military star-
    ships and main battle tanks. Almost any target will be anni-
    hilated unless protected by force screens; a barrage can lay
    waste to a city.

        Tangler Pistol, 25mm (TL9): A pistol-sized tangler that
     uses a less powerful compressed air charge.
        Wrist Needler, 3mm (TL9): A needler designed to be
     strapped to the wrist and concealed up a sleeve. It incorpo-
     rates a simple neural input sensor reading muscle signals.
     A trained shooter can fire it with no more effort than point-
     ing a finger, but it’s tricky to use without practice. Double
     penalties for lack of familiarity.
        Ice Gun(TL10): These use compressed gas to fire nee-
     dles of frozen liquid. The needles dissolve without a trace in
     the target’s body. They are intended for survival or assassi-
     nation. Each 20-shot magazine includes a self-contained
     refrigeration unit. Pour a cup of water into the magazine,
     activate the refrigeration unit, and in half an hour (five
     minutes at TL11, one minute at TL12), 20 new ice needles
     will be ready to fire. A single C cell can freeze 100 maga-
     zines’ worth of ice needles.
        An ice gun may also deliver drugged rounds. A dose of
     any hypo-injected drug or poison can be pre-frozen into a
     sliver and fired, with the normal follow-up effect if it pene-
     trates. Add the cost of 20 doses of that drug or poison.
        Partisan Needler, 3mm(TL10): This spring-rifle weapon
     is designed for low-tech guerrilla fighters, or for use by peo-
     ple planning a long stay in cultures that can’t produce
     sophisticated ammo. The solar-powered flywheel foundry
     in the stock makes its own ammunition. It can produce 140
     needles in an hour using a 2¥3¥1-inch metal block ($1),
     which can be made by any village blacksmith with access
     to ore. After that, it must recharge for 10 hours in the sun.

     Option: Non-Metallic
        All these weapons except the partisan needler may be
     made of non-metallic materials for 1.5 times normal cost,
     allowing an unloaded weapon to bypass ordinary metal
     detectors.

   This is a single-shot launch tube with a pistol grip and
an electronics system. It holds one mini-missile, but can be
reloaded after each shot if extra missiles are carried. It is
light enough (six pounds loaded) that every soldier could
carry one.
   The launcher fires a supersonic missile with a 64mm
warhead. It produces a dangerous backblast when fired,
doing 2d burning damage to everyone within a cone up to
two yards behind the launcher.
   Each missile costs $100 without a warhead; homing
missiles (p. 146) cost more. The usual warhead is a solid
“kinetic kill” projectile inflicting the listed piercing damage.
The warhead costs $10; multiply this figure for the more
expensive warheads listed under        Warheads and
Ammunition(pp. 152-159).
Multiple Light Anti-Armor Weapon System
(MLAWS), 64mm (TL9-10)
   The MLAWS is a six-tube launcher with a loaded weight
of 35 pounds. It is quite hefty, but its lack of recoil allows
an ordinary person to fire it. The MLAWS is used as a squad
support weapon, although it’s not uncommon to see them
attached to post mounts on vehicles or hung under the
pylons of attack aircraft. The MLAWS fires the same mis-
sile as an IML (see above), with the same options and back-
blast hazard.
Tactical Missile Launcher (TML), 100mm (TL9)
   This bulky launch tube holds a single pre-packaged mis-
sile. An unguided rocket costs $400; missiles with guidance
systems cost more. The basic warhead is a 100mm solid
“kinetic kill” projectile that inflicts the listed piercing 
damage. This costs $40; multiply this figure for the more
expensive warheads listed under        Warheads and
Ammunition(pp. 152-159). It has a potentially lethal back-
blast when fired, doing 4d burning damage to everyone
within a cone up to three yards behind the launcher.

    Targeting with Active Sensors
      The most accurate way to aim a weapon is to slave a tar-
    geting program (p.  149) to a “tactical” active sensor (see
    Chapter 3) that has locked onto a target. This feeds real-
    time ranging data to the gunner and shows the gunner
    exactly how to move the weapon (or vehicle, if a fixed
    weapon) to hit the target.
      This can only be used for a mounted weapon (i.e., one
    using Gunner skill). The combination of targeting program
    and active sensor gives the maximum possible targeting
    bonus. Replaceall bonuses for scopes, computers, sensors,
    etc. with a bonus equal to the weapon’s base Acc. In other
    words, its Acc is effectively doubled. (Acc does still increase
    normally with Aim maneuvers – +1 after one second, +2
    after two seconds, etc.)
      In order to gain this bonus, the target must be in range
    of the active sensor, and the program must be able to pro-
    vide data directly to either the vehicle operator or whoever
    is operating the weapon mount.

    Proximity Detonation
       If the warhead is fused for proximity detonation, a sen-
    sor will detonate it when it is in the air, close to the intend-
    ed target. Use the Attacking an Area (p. B414) rules: roll to
    hit at +4, and the square of the margin of failure is the dis-
    tance missed by. Proximity-fuse airbursts can attack areas
    in space or the air as well as an area of ground.
       A proximity detonation round inflicts only fragmenta-
    tion damage, typically in a cone in the direction of the shot.
    If used for indirect fire, apply the rules for    Airbursts
    (p. B415): the fragments rain down from above, bypassing
    any cover that is not overhead and negating attack penal-
    ties to hit crouching, kneeling, sitting, or prone targets.
    Most HE rounds use laser proximity fuses, which are
    immune to radio-frequency jamming.

Armor Type
   Select ballistic (p. 172), reflec (p. 173), ablative (p. 173),
bioplas (p. 171), or energy (p. 174) body armor. Record the
statistics of the suit version of that armor type. Its DR, cost,
weight, and LC will be used as the basis of the rest of the
outfit.
   Example: We choose a TL10 tailored nanoweave body-
suit (p. 172 ) as the basis of our outfit. To start with, it has
DR 18/6, covers all locations, and is $1,200, 8 lbs. and LC3.

Coverage
   Choose the locations that are covered by the outfit. Each
location has its own multiplier; add the multipliers for all
locations covered. This will give the “coverage multiplier”
of the entire outfit. The numbers add up to 1 (all locations
covered).

   Gravity Cloak (TL12^)
      A successor to the grav belt, this is a much lighter
   system. It might take the form of a flexible cloak made
   out of solid-state gravitic circuitry. Fastened around the
   neck and at each wrist, it generates a contragravity
   field, enabling the user to fly in the same manner as
   with a grav belt. It may be controlled through arm
   movements (at -2 to skill) or through a neural interface
   built into the cloak fastening (which also contains a C
   cell). It takes two seconds to put on, one to remove. 5

      These are microgravity flight rigs used for short-range
   travel outside of spacecraft or space stations. They use cold-
   gas thrusters to provide maneuverability, and can be easily
   donned, doffed, and serviced by a single individual. Use
   Free Fall skill to operate them.

   Hand Thruster (TL9)
      A hand thruster propels the user with bursts of 
   compressed gas. Each burst accelerates or decelerates a
   normal-mass human by one yard per second in the direc-
   tion opposite to that in which the thruster is pointed. A suc-
   cessful roll against Free Fall or Vacc Suit skill is necessary
   to point the thruster in the desired direction. The unit’s
   cylinder is good for 30 one-second bursts. A hand thruster
   weighs four pounds, including the cylinder; extra cylinders
   cost $10, weigh one pound and take three seconds to
   replace.

    (more for a planet with a thinner atmosphere, such as
    Mars). During this time, radio, radar, and all passive sen-
    sors will be blinded due to plasma effects.
       Life pods and drop capsules incorporate a computer
    with Navigation (Space)-12, or the user can override this
    and program his own landing. Critical success means the
    user lands within a mile of where he intended. Success
    means he’s within 5d ¥ 100 miles, less 200 miles times his
    margin of success (e.g., success by 5 reduces the radius by
    1,000 miles), minimum one mile. Failure means he could
    be anywhere on the planet. Critical failure means a disaster
    of some sort: landing in rough terrain, getting stuck in orbit
    without fuel to deorbit, or optionally, a too-steep reentry
    that results in the capsule burning up (a fate best left to

  GURPS Ultra-Tech is a sourcebook for science-fiction
technology, from the near future to the farthest reaches
of the imagination. It’s a valuable companion to  GURPS
Space, GURPS Bio-Tech, and GURPS Infinite Worlds,
and for any character or campaign that needs advanced
technological equipment. 
  GURPS Ultra-Tech is full of personal equipment for
heroes and superheroes from TL9 to TL12, including:

• Weapons – from caseless assault carbines and
  monomolecular swords to antimatter warheads and
  disassembler nano.
• Protection – How do you stop a nanomorph assassin with a 
  field-jacketed X-ray laser rifle? Try a dreadnought battlesuit and a personal force screen . . .
• Medicine – Superscience can heal, rebuild, and improve on nature. Death itself can become 
  a temporary inconvenience.
• Transport – Air cars, hovertanks, tilt rotors, grav belts, supercavitating minisubs, matter-
  transport booths – lots of ways to get where the action is, for the adventurer on the go!

  And still more gadgets! Living biosuits, computer implants, holographic projectors, psionic
amplifiers, neutrino communicators, nanofactories, chameleon suits, repair paste, Dyson
spheres – there’s something for every adventure at every tech level.

               GURPS Ultra-Techrequires the GURPS Basic Set, Fourth Edition. 
                The ideas in this book can be used with any science-fiction game.
