//Together we all began another certainly successful mission to Mars 
The Massie Ferganson Tractor Beam released Billy Fae Bots at a calm and peaceful 44 miles above Theta 
Immediately loving gravity began pulling softly on her tight organic curves 
The race began
She saw some of this on her long thin wounded arm
On the screen she only noticed an immense poppy field of stars
Billy Fae Bots felt at peace inside this world living on the Glass^tm attached her wrist
After many expierences in New Eden she always rememebered to drink GlopRatchet
Also she know her body would evenutally fall from all this beauty
KBAR the Endless wrathfully reminded her to observe the rules of the race
She needed to slow her falling body down to a speed of 144 meters per second 
On then could her responsibility be safely dropped into a nest  
If all went smoothly an alligator snapping turtle egg inside her would hatch


"Let's go ahead and [[trip the Cotton Candy Shield]]", her delicate voice [[bounced off walls of paintings]] in a small Brooklyn Apartment 

[[Trip The Cotton Candy Shield]]
The fibers of the Cotton Candy Shield stretched out in all directions
A shift in the pull of gravity reverses the direction of her Body
Now other celestials exhaust charms on her 
Billy Fae Bots is one of the Bounded once more


[[Bounced off Walls of Paintings]]
After looking in the eyes of her beautiful daughter laughing at her side loving the graphics playing on the screen, she finally understood her most important choice of all
She could just trust

Sunlight blasted its way millions of miles across space
The Solar Panel was able to convert 34 percent of it to usable energy

She thought about [[answering a work email]] but needed that time to [[adjust the air flow of the vapor intake]]

Instead she watched her minuture self roll down into the outer most patch of clouds



[[Answer a work email]]
While not event close to being a slave, she felt like constantly needing to be at others beck and call for all hours of the day even weekends
The program minimized itself with out complaint
An email App took its place instanly
Time must be worshipped and tracked
Billy Fae Bots is one of the Bounded once more


[[Adjust the air flow of the vapor intake]]





The Googizon quickly soared through cross shaped clouds of the baby blue sky
Its fusion cells hummed with quiet laughter
45,5455,343 package deleiverys complete today
The Endless prototype #00001 KBAR fell from from above
The two radically divided pieces of technology where a mere 56 seconds from collision
The both regestarted as small little blips flicked on her screen billions of years away
She had an oppertuniy to either launch the alligator skin parachute or trigger the cotton candy shields
An oppertuinity presented itself to either launch the chute or fire the cotton candy shields
After launching the chute the egg slowly glided down until it landed where it needed to be
The chasis opened revealing a turtle egg inside

The sunlight joins with the snow for a moment.
The sunlight does a whirling dance with the snow. 
A Honey Bee approaches the shadow. 
A Honey Bee and the shadow pass each other quietly. 
A Honey Bee glances the Okeenokee Swamp. 
A Honey Bee flickers away . 
The shadow passes through the sunlight. 
The shadow is illuminated by the sunlight. 
The Okeenokee Swamp discovers a Honey Bee conversing silently with the shadow. 
The Okeenokee Swamp observes the patterns of a Honey Bee conversing silently with the shadow. 
The Okeenokee Swamp dwells in the stillness of life .

An old man sits in a recliner and turns on a giant screen

The old man smiles
