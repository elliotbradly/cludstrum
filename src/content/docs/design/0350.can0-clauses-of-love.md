I saw a little quiver pass down Ayesha's frame,
shuddered myself,
To this day I often
dream of that
awful scene,

marked like Cain,

Another dream that

After all that

expected that
she would take the earliest opportunity of claiming the
man she believed to be her old-world lover,
but this,
for some reason of
her own,
which was at the time quite inscrutable to me,
she did not do.
All that
she did was to attend to his wants quietly,
with a humility

particularly anxious to see her face,

it a fit time for love,
Ustane,
my servant--and

"Play not with me," moaned the wretched woman;
"slay me,

It is not well to go so swift from the hot lips of love down
to the cold mouth of the grave," and
she made a motion to the mutes,
instantly stepped up and
caught the girl by either arm.
"I did it,
oh She ," she answered,
drawing herself up to the full of
her stately height,
throwing back the panther skin from her head,
"because my love is stronger than the grave.
I did it because my life

It sounds horrible and

there is love--love which makes all things beautiful,

With love shall
life roll gloriously on from year to year,
like the voice of some great
music that

in astonishment;

I only wish I could describe the wild and
marvellous beauty

I was never guilty
of any serious misconduct,

trouble.
I remember,
however,
that
my sense of humor was so sly that
only one who did not so wound me;
up to this day I recall with a
swelling heart his clumsy efforts to make me understand

at this time the majority of my white schoolmates

powers of expression.
She was my first love,
and
I loved her as only a boy loves.
I dreamed
of her,
I built air castles for her,
she was the incarnation of each
poetry I had written.
Of course,
the reader must know that
all of this adoration was in
secret;
next to my great love for this young lady was the dread that
in some way she would find it out.
I did not know what some men never
find out,

she is loved has

the delights of music and
love.
I saw delights of love without

so romantic,

But there may have been something of calculation even in her wildest

strive to
equal themselves where equality is not possible.
For her husband

less than himself.
Among the names which her husband
mentioned there was one which,

In the evening a feast was prepared,

When Mongan saw these cows,
he fell in love with them as he had never

He came down from the window and
walked on the sunny lawn among the
cows,
looking at each of them and
speaking words of affection and
looked from the cows then,
saw that
the King of Leinster was at his
side.
“Are you in love with the cows?
” Branduv asked him.
“I am,” said Mongan.
Duv Laca wanted to know where the cows came from,
Mongan told her
the King of Leinster had given them to him.
She fell in love with

but there was nobody in the world could have

Everything they did they did

“But,” she continued,
“they will not prevent my going away,
for they all
know that
I have been in love with you for ages.
“What have you been in with me for ages?
” said the amazed king.
“In love with you,” replied Duv Laca.
“This is news,” said the king,
it is good news.

“I will not go with you unless you
“Why do you bind these woes on me?

“I wish to find out if you truly love me.
“But I do,” said the king.
“I love you madly and
dearly,
with all my
faculties and
members.
“That is the way!

“We shall have a notable

Mongan took her chin in his hand

for you are lovely,” said he,

the joy of the world.
Then the attendants brought him wine,
he drank so joyously of that
the rafters of the house went creaking.
Said he:
Mongan loved Duv Laca of the White Hand
better than he loved his life,
better than he loved his honour.
The kingdoms of the world did not weigh
with him beside the string of her shoe.
“Duv Laca says that
you are to come at once,

She had a tall skinny dog behind her called Brotar.
The hag took the cat off her shoulder and
gave it to mac an Da’v.
“Hold that

“Would you like to be a lovely young girl?
” asked Mongan.
“I’d sooner be that

more lovely and
more

at last there was not a bone in his body as big as an
inch that
was not filled with love and
longing for the girl.
Every few minutes he gave a great sigh as if he had eaten too much,
Duv Laca asked him if he had eaten too much he said he had but
this was as wise a thing as anybody had ever said.
And then he sent a
message to say that
he loved her so much that
he would certainly burst
of love if it did not stop.
Mongan heard the whispering,
he told the hag that
if she did what he
advised she would certainly get either himself or the King of Leinster
for a husband.
“Either of you will be welcome,” said the hag.
“When the king says he loves you,
ask him to prove it by gifts;
ask for
his drinking-horn first.
She asked for that,
he sent it to her filled with good liquor;
She told the servant that,

Branduv heard it he nearly went mad with love and

with rage also,
because of the treasure he had given her and
not get back.
“Aren’t you the Hag of the Mill?
“I am indeed,” she replied,
I love you dearly.
“I wish I didn’t see you,” said Branduv.
That was the end of the story,

Those who fall in love with practice without science are like a

because it may thus drive out useless things and

The lover is moved by the beloved object as the senses are by
sensible objects;
they unite and
become one and
the same thing.
The work is the first thing born of this union;
if the thing loved
is base the lover becomes base.
When the thing taken into union is perfectly adapted to that
which
receives it,
the result is delight and
pleasure and
satisfaction.
When that
which loves is united to the thing beloved it can rest
there;
the burden is laid down it finds rest there.

to love and

all relation to ourselves,
to care about the destiny of man and
development of the universe without a thought that
we are personally

religious love does not bridge the gulf that

looks across the gulf,
it views others with compassion or impersonal
sympathy,
but it does not live with the same life with which they live.
Patriotism affords an example of the kind of control which is needed.
Patriotism is compounded out of a number of instinctive feelings and
impulses:
love of home,
love of those whose ways and
outlook resemble
our own,
the impulse to coöperation in a group,
the sense of pride
in the achievements of one’s group.

All these impulses and
desires unite to produce a love of man’s own country which is more
deeply implanted in the fiber of his being,
more closely united to
his vital force,

But if spirit
does not enter in to generalize love of country,
the exclusiveness of
instinctive love makes it a source of hatred of other countries.
What
spirit can effect is to make us realize that
other countries equally
are worthy of love,
the vital warmth which makes us love our own
country reveals to us that
it deserves to be loved,
only the
poverty of our nature prevents us from loving all countries as we love
In this way instinctive love can be extended in imagination,
a sense of the value of all mankind can grow up,
which is more
living and
intense than any that
is possible to those whose instinctive
love is weak.
Mind can only show us that
it is irrational to love our
own country best;
it can weaken patriotism,
but cannot strengthen
the love of all mankind.
Spirit alone can do this,
by extending and
universalizing the love that
is born of instinct.
And in doing this it
checks and
purifies whatever is insistent or ruthless or oppressively
personal in the life of instinct.
The same extension through spirit is necessary with other instinctive
loves,
if they are not to be enfeebled or corrupted by thought.

The instinctive man in love feels that
his emotion is unique,
the lady of his heart has perfections such as no other woman ever
equaled.
The man who has acquired the power of impersonal thought
realizes,
he is in love,
he is one of so many millions of
men who are in love at this moment,
not more than one of all the
millions can be right in thinking his love supreme,
it is not
likely that
one is oneself.
He perceives that
the state of being
in love in those whose instinct is unaffected by thought or spirit,
is a state of illusion,

pass to a new life,
where instinct is purified and
yet nourished by the
deeper desires and
insight of spirit.
The man who has the life of the spirit within him views the love of man
both in himself and
in others,
quite differently from the
man who is exclusively dominated by mind.
He sees,
in his moments of

in all human beings there is something deserving of love,
something mysterious,
something appealing,

Instinct becomes a reinforcement to spiritual insight.

No benefit to others is

Mind can weaken the impulse to

diminish the force of instinctive love,

Spirit can do this.
It can leave the instinctive love of children

much to say about this man and his work, probably because of his close relationship with
Phidias.
Agoracritus was so beloved by his teacher, Pliny says, that Phidias allowed some of
his own works to bear the signature of the younger sculptor
(NH 36.

Like Myron’s cow, its
lifelikeness was celebrated in epigram, and numerous authors cite its extraordinary beauty.
The sculptor’s own lover Phryne, some say, was its model, and she, like her alter ego,
brazenly unrobed and bathed “in view of all the Greeks.

into the distance, or as some have it, at an approaching lover – Ares.
She does not cover
herself but lets go of her cloak, unconcerned with what anyone might see.

Some commentators on Plato

In Socrates account beauty is love s highest object.
To grasp this,
we must make a Platonic metaphysical distinction between on the one hand

That reading seems to make best sense of Beauty s being an
object of love on a continuum with other such objects,
though whether Plato
thinks of Beauty as being beautiful in the same way as a boy or girl is beautiful
is a matter of debate.
no object or property accessible to the senses can be what constitutes beauty as
such.
A similar distinction occurs in the Republic,
where Plato disparages lovers
of sights and
sounds
(Republic 475d-476b)
who eagerly attend arts festivals,
but
think there are many beautifuls rather than the single Form of The Beautiful
the philosopher recognizes.
In the Symposium the ideal lover is portrayed as ascending through a hierarchy
of love-objects first the beautiful body of a particular human beloved,
then all
beautiful bodies equally,
then the beauty of souls,

Jealousy and
romantic love are familiar emotions expressed in
literature,
but I can read a poem expressing all-consuming jealousy in the first
person
(Browning s My Last Duchess,
for instance)
without becoming to the
faintest degree jealous myself,
just as I can read a love poem without falling in love
myself.
It might be claimed,
more modestly,
the poem must be counted a failure
if it leaves its readers as uncomprehending of jealousy

as before.

First note that

Why is the vehicle of its destructiveness a dark secret
We need,
for the moment lack,
answers to these various questions,
general and
specific.
What was Blake s point in writing about the
sick rose,
in describing the worm as invisible,
in making it first appear in a
howling storm,
in describing its destructiveness in terms of a secret love?
This approach is plausible because it reflects an important aspect of our
explanatory stance when
we are trying to understand
human behavior and
we have already broached,
if barely,
a matter of interpretation.
Finally,

what art teaches us is essentially connected with how it teaches us.

Lyrics
New love,
a boy and
girl are talking
New words,
that
only they can share in,
a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeing hours of morning.
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross and
baby,
Love descends on those defenceless
Idiot love will spark the fusion.
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove,
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving.
Soul love,
the priest that
tastes the word
And told of love and
how my God on high is all love
Though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that
surrounds him.

Thou shalt love the Lord thy

with all thy soul,
with all thy mind.
22:38 This is the first and
great commandment.
22:39 And the second is like unto it,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as

O Israel;
The Lord our God
is one Lord:
12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart,
with all thy
strength:
this is the first commandment.
12:31 And the second is like,
namely this,

There is none other commandment greater than
12:32 And the scribe said unto him,
Well,
thou hast said the
truth:
for there is one God;
there is none other but he:
12:33 And
to love him with all the heart,
with all the understanding,
with all the soul,
with all the strength,
to love his
neighbour as himself,
is more than all whole burnt offerings and
sacrifices.
And the common people heard him gladly.
12:38 And he said unto them in his doctrine,
Beware of the scribes,

love salutations in the
marketplaces,

uppermost rooms at feasts:

houses,

3:15 That whosoever believeth in him
should not perish,
but have eternal life.
3:16 For God so loved the world,
he gave his only begotten Son,
whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have
everlasting life.
the only begotten Son of God.
3:19 And this is the condemnation,
light is come into the world,
men loved darkness rather than light,
because their deeds were
evil.
3:20 For every one that
doeth evil hateth the light,
neither cometh to
3:34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God:
for God
giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
3:35 The Father loveth the Son,
hath given all things into his
hand.
3:36 He that
believeth on the Son hath everlasting life:
Father do:
for what things soever he doeth,
these also doeth the Son
5:20 For the Father loveth the Son,
sheweth him all things that
himself doeth:
he will shew him greater works than these,
may marvel.
5:40 And ye will not come to me,
ye might have life.
5:41 I receive not honour from men.
5:42 But I know you,
ye have not the love of God in you.
5:43 I am come in my Father's name,
ye receive me not:
if another
shall come in his own name,
him ye will receive.
Then said they to him,
We be not
born of fornication;
we have one Father,
even God.

If God were your Father,
ye would love me:
for I proceeded forth and
came from God;
neither came I of myself,

he sent me.

they shall hear my voice;
there shall be one fold,
one shepherd.
10:17 Therefore doth my Father love me,
because I lay down my life,
I might take it again.
10:18 No man taketh it from me,
but I lay it down of myself.
11:3
Therefore his sisters sent unto him,
Lord,
he whom
thou lovest is sick.
11:4 When Jesus heard that,
he said,
This sickness is not unto death,
but for the glory of God,
the Son of God might be glorified
thereby.
11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha,
her sister,
Lazarus.

he was sick,
he abode two days

11:35 Jesus wept.
11:36 Then said the Jews,
Behold how he loved him!
11:37 And some of
them said,
Could not this man,
which opened the eyes of the blind,
the ground and
die,
it abideth alone:
but if it die,
it bringeth forth
much fruit.
12:25 He that
loveth his life shall lose it;
hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
12:26 If any man serve me,
let him follow me;
where I am,
there
12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him,
lest they
should be put out of the synagogue:
12:43 For they loved the praise of
men more than the praise of God.
12:44 Jesus cried and
believeth on me,
believeth not on
13:1 Now before the feast of the passover,
Jesus knew that
his
hour was come that
he should depart out of this world unto the Father,
having loved his own which were in the world,
he loved them unto the
end.
13:2 And supper being ended,
the devil having now put into the heart
spake.
13:23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples,
whom
Jesus loved.
13:24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him,
he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake.
as I said unto the Jews,
Whither I go,
ye cannot come;
so now
I say to you.
13:34 A new commandment I give unto you,
That ye love one another;
as
I have loved you,
ye also love one another.
13:35 By this shall all men know that
ye are my disciples,
if ye have
love one to another.
13:36 Simon Peter said unto him,
whither goest thou?
Jesus
Father may be glorified in the Son.
14:14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name,
I will do it.
14:15 If ye love me,
keep my commandments.
14:16 And I will pray the Father,
he shall give you another
Comforter,
he may abide with you for ever;
14:17 Even the Spirit
I in you.
14:21 He that
hath my commandments,
keepeth them,
he it is that
loveth me:
loveth me shall be loved of my Father,
will love him,
will manifest myself to him.
14:22 Judas saith unto him,
not Iscariot,
how is it that
wilt manifest thyself unto us,
not unto the world?
14:23 Jesus
If a man love me,
he will keep my words:
my Father will love him,
we will come unto him,
make our
abode with him.
14:24 He that
loveth me not keepeth not my sayings:
the word which
ye hear is not mine,
but the Father's which sent me.
14:25 These things have I spoken unto you,
being yet present with you.
14:28 Ye have heard how I said unto you,
I go away,
come again
unto you.
If ye loved me,
ye would rejoice,
because I said,
I go unto
the Father:
for my Father is greater than I.
14:29 And now I have told you before it come to pass,
it is
14:30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you:
for the prince of this
world cometh,
hath nothing in me.
14:31 But that
the world may know that
I love the Father;
as the
Father gave me commandment,
even so I do.
Arise,
let us go hence.
15:8 Herein is my Father glorified,
ye bear much fruit;
so shall
ye be my disciples.
15:9 As the Father hath loved me,
so have I loved you:
continue ye in
my love.
15:10 If ye keep my commandments,
ye shall abide in my love;
even as I
have kept my Father's commandments,
abide in his love.
15:11 These things have I spoken unto you,
my joy might remain in
you,
your joy might be full.
15:12 This is my commandment,
as I have
loved you.
15:13 Greater love hath no man than this,
a man lay down his life
for his friends.
15:14 Ye are my friends,
if ye do whatsoever I command
remain:
whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name,
he may
give it you.
15:17 These things I command
ye love one another.
15:18 If the world hate you,
ye know that
it hated me before it hated
15:19 If ye were of the world,
the world would love his own:
because ye are not of the world,
but I have chosen you out of the
world,
therefore the world hateth you.
16:26 At that
day ye shall ask in my name:
I say not unto you,
I will pray the Father for you:
16:27 For the Father himself
loveth you,
because ye have loved me,
have believed that
I came
out from God.
16:28 I came forth from the Father,
am come into the world:
again,
may be one,
even as we are one:
17:23 I in them,
thou in me,
they may be made perfect in one;
hast sent me,
hast loved them,
as thou hast loved me.
17:24 Father,
I will that
they also,
whom thou hast given me,
be with
me where I am;
they may behold my glory,
which thou hast given
for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
17:25 O righteous Father,
the world hath not known thee:
but I have
known thee,
these have known that
thou hast sent me.
17:26 And I have declared unto them thy name,
will declare it:
the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them,
I in
them.
18:1 When Jesus had spoken these words,
he went forth with his
mother's sister,
Mary the wife of Cleophas,
Mary Magdalene.
19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother,
the disciple standing
by,
whom he loved,
he saith unto his mother,
Woman,
behold thy son!
19:27 Then saith he to the disciple,
Behold thy mother!
And from that
the sepulchre.
20:2 Then she runneth,
cometh to Simon Peter,
to the other
disciple,
whom Jesus loved,
saith unto them,
They have taken away
the LORD out of the sepulchre,
we know not where they have laid
him.
They cast therefore,
now they were not
able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
21:7 Therefore that
disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter,
the Lord.
Now when
Simon Peter heard that
it was the Lord,
he girt his
disciples,
after that
he was risen from the dead.
21:15 So when
they had dined,
Jesus saith to Simon Peter,
Simon,
son
of Jonas,
lovest thou me more than these?
He saith unto him,
Yea,
thou knowest that
I love thee.
Feed my lambs.
21:16 He saith to him again the second time,
son of Jonas,
lovest thou me?
I love
Feed my sheep.
21:17 He saith unto him the third time,
lovest
thou me?
Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time,
And he said unto him,
thou knowest all things;
Jesus saith unto him,
21:18 Verily,
verily,
I say unto thee,
When thou wast young,
21:19 This spake he,
signifying by what death he should glorify God.
And when
he had spoken this,
Follow me.
21:20 Then Peter,
turning about,
seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
following;
which also leaned on his breast at supper,
which is he that
betrayeth thee?
2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind,
it filled all the house where they were sitting.
2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
it sat upon each of them.
2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,
began to speak
be circumcised,
keep the law:
to whom we gave no such commandment:
15:25 It seemed good unto us,
being assembled with one accord,
to send
chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and
Paul,
15:26 Men that
have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15:27 We have sent therefore Judas and
Silas,
who shall also tell you
we have received grace and
apostleship,
for obedience to the faith
among all nations,
for his name:
1:6 Among whom are ye also the called
of Jesus Christ:
1:7 To all that
be in Rome,
beloved of God,
called to
be saints:
Grace to you and
peace from God our Father,
Jesus Christ.
5:3 And not only so,
but we glory in tribulations also:
knowing that
tribulation worketh patience;
5:4 And patience,
experience;
hope:
5:5 And hope maketh not ashamed;
because the love of
God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto
us.
5:7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die:
yet peradventure
for a good man some would even dare to die.
5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us,
in that,
while we were yet
sinners,
Christ died for us.
5:9 Much more then,
being now justified by his blood,
we shall be
will of God.
8:28 And we know that
all things work together for good to them that
love God,
to them who are the called according to his purpose.

neither death,

nor powers,

nor depth,
nor any other creature,

The elder shall serve the

Jacob have I loved,

Is there unrighteousness with God?

they are enemies for your sakes:
as touching the election,

for he that

Thou shalt not kill,
Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Thou shalt

if there be any other commandment,
it is briefly

4:17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus,
who is my beloved

who shall bring you into remembrance of
my ways which be in Christ,
as I teach every where in every church.

The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
2:4 For out of much affliction and
anguish of heart I wrote unto you
with many tears;
not that
ye should be grieved,
but that
ye might know
the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
2:5 But if any have caused grief,
he hath not grieved me,
but in part:
I may not overcharge you all.
lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow.
2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that
ye would confirm your love toward

I might know the proof of

it is to God:
or whether we
be sober,
it is for your cause.

because we thus judge,
if one died for all,
then were all dead:
5:15 And that
he died

imprisonments,

let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and

holiness in the fear of God.

8:7 Therefore,
as ye abound in every thing,
in faith,
utterance,
knowledge,
in all diligence,
in your love to us,
see that
ye abound in this grace also.
8:8 I speak not by commandment,
but by occasion of the forwardness of
others,
to prove the sincerity of your love.

though he
was rich,
yet for your sakes he became poor,

8:24 Wherefore shew ye to them,
before the churches,
the proof of
your love,
of our boasting on your behalf.

it is superfluous
for me to write to you:

so let him give;
not grudgingly,
or of necessity:
for God loveth a cheerful giver.

we should be holy and
without blame before him in love:
1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
Christ to himself,
according to the good pleasure of his will,
1:6 To
the praise of the glory of his grace,
wherein he hath made us accepted
in the beloved.
1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood,
the forgiveness of
sins,
according to the riches of his grace;

1:15 Wherefore I also,
after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,

making mention of you in my prayers;
1:17 That the God of our Lord
the Father of glory,

who is rich in mercy,
for his great love wherewith he

we were dead in sins,

the love of Christ,
which passeth knowledge,
ye might be filled
with all the fulness of God.
3:20 Now unto him that
is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
4:1 I therefore,
the prisoner of the Lord,
beseech you that
ye walk
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
4:2 With all lowliness
meekness,
with longsuffering,
forbearing one another in love;
4:3
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
4:4 There is one body,
one Spirit,
even as ye are called in one
with every wind of doctrine,
by the sleight of men,
cunning
craftiness,
whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
4:15 But speaking the
truth in love,
may grow up into him in all things,
which is the head,

compacted by that
which every joint supplieth,
according to the
effectual working in the measure of every part,
maketh increase of the
body unto the edifying of itself in love.
4:17 This I say therefore,
testify in the Lord,
ye henceforth
walk not as other Gentiles walk,
in the vanity of their mind,
4:18
Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God,
as dear children;
5:2 And walk
in love,
as Christ also hath loved us,
hath given himself for us

a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

so let the wives
be to their own husbands in every thing.
5:25 Husbands,

even as Christ also loved the church,

cleanse it
with the washing of water by the word,
5:27 That he might present it
to himself a glorious church,
not having spot,
or wrinkle,
or any such
thing;
it should be holy and
without blemish.

how I do,
Tychicus,

you all things:

Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ.
6:24 Grace be with all them that
love our Lord Jesus Christ in

1:8 For God is my record,
how greatly I long after you all in the
bowels of Jesus Christ.

your love may abound yet more and
more in
knowledge and
in all judgment;
1:10 That ye may approve things that
are excellent;
ye may be sincere and
without offence till the day
1:15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and
strife;
some also
of good will:
1:16 The one preach Christ of contention,
not sincerely,
supposing to add affliction to my bonds:

I am set for the defence of the gospel.

if any comfort of

if any fellowship of the Spirit,
if any bowels and

Fulfil ye my joy,
ye be likeminded,
having the same love,
of one accord,

but in lowliness

every tongue should confess that

to the glory of God the Father.

as ye have always obeyed,
not as in my
presence only,
but now much more in my absence,
work out your own
salvation with fear and
trembling.

according to the working whereby he is
able even to subdue all things unto himself.

my brethren dearly beloved and

beseech Syntyche,
they be of the same
mind in the Lord.

whatsoever things are true,
whatsoever things
are honest,
whatsoever things are just,
whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are of good report;
if
there be any virtue,
if there be any praise,
think on these
things.
1:3 We give thanks to God and
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
always for you,
1:4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,
of the love which ye
have to all the saints,
1:5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,
whereof ye heard
1:7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant,
who is for you
a faithful minister of Christ;
1:8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
1:9 For this cause we also,
since the day we heard it,

know how ye ought to answer every man.

brother,
a faithful minister and
fellowservant in the Lord:

he might know
your estate,
comfort your hearts;

in the
sight of God and
our Father;
1:4 Knowing,
brethren beloved,
your
election of God.
1:5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only,
but also in power,
3:11 Now God himself and
our
Father,
our Lord Jesus Christ,
direct our way unto you.
3:12 And the Lord make you to increase and
abound in love one toward
another,
toward all men,
even as we do toward you:
3:13 To the end
he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God,

despiseth not man,
but God,

but to obtain salvation by

love which is in Christ Jesus.
1:15 This is a faithful saying,
worthy of all acceptation,
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;

Timothy our brother,
unto
Philemon our dearly beloved,
fellowlabourer,
1:2 And to our
beloved Apphia,
Archippus our fellowsoldier,
to the church in
thy house:
1:3 Grace to you,
from God our Father and
1:4 I thank my God,
making mention of thee always in my prayers,

Hearing of thy love and
which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus,
toward all saints;
1:6 That the communication of thy faith may
become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in
you in Christ Jesus.
1:7 For we have great joy and
consolation in thy love,
because the
bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee,
1:8 Wherefore,
though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee
which is convenient,
1:9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech
being such an one as Paul the aged,
now also a prisoner of

shouldest receive him for ever;
1:16 Not now as a servant,
but above a
servant,
a brother beloved,
specially to me,
but how much more unto
both in the flesh,
in the Lord?
1:17 If thou count me
1:8 But unto the Son he saith,
Thy throne,
O God,
is for ever and
ever:
a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

hated iniquity;
therefore God,
even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows.

whose end is to be
burned.
6:9 But,
we are persuaded better things of you,
accompany salvation,
though we thus speak.
6:10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and
labour of
which ye have shewed toward his name,
ye have ministered
to the saints,
do minister.
6:11 And we desire that
every one of you do shew the same diligence to

promised;)
10:24 And let us consider one
another to provoke unto love and
to good works:
10:25 Not forsaking
the assembling of ourselves together,
as the manner of some is;
exhorting one another:
so much the more,
as ye see the day
12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
unto children,
My son,
despise not thou the chastening of the Lord,
nor faint when
thou art rebuked of him:
12:6 For whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth,
scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
12:7 If ye endure chastening,
God dealeth with you as with sons;
have grace,
whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and
godly fear:

13:2 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers:
for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares.
1:12 Blessed is the man that
endureth temptation:
for when
he is
tried,
he shall receive the crown of life,
which the Lord hath
promised to them that

he is tempted,
I am tempted of God:
cannot be tempted with evil,
neither tempteth he any man:

my
beloved brethren,
Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in
heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that

Do not rich men oppress

worthy name by the which ye are called?

hope might be in God.
1:22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren,
ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently:

not of
corruptible seed,
but of incorruptible,
by the word of God,
which

but are now the people of

I beseech you as strangers and

from fleshly lusts,

conversation honest among the Gentiles:

3:8 Finally,
be ye all of one mind,

think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
to try you,

rejoice,

eyewitnesses of his majesty.
1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and

3:1 This second epistle,
I now write unto you;
in both which
I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
3:2 That ye may be
mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,
now,
by the same word are kept in store,
reserved unto fire against
the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men.
3:8 But,
be not ignorant of this one thing,
one day is
with the Lord as a thousand
years,
a thousand
years as one day.
3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise,
as some men count
3:13 Nevertheless we,
according to his promise,
look for new heavens and
a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness.
3:14 Wherefore,
seeing that
ye look for such things,
diligent that
ye may be found of him in peace,
without spot,
blameless.
3:15 And account that
the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation;
as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto
him hath written unto you;
3:16 As also in all his epistles,
speaking
in them of these things;
in which are some things hard to be
understood,
which they that
are unlearned and
unstable wrest,
as they
do also the other scriptures,
unto their own destruction.
3:17 Ye therefore,
seeing ye know these things before,
beware
lest ye also,
being led away with the error of the wicked,
fall from
your own stedfastness.
2:4 He that
I know him,
keepeth not his commandments,
is a
liar,
the truth is not in him.
2:5 But whoso keepeth his word,
in him verily is the love of God
perfected:
hereby know we that
we are in him.
2:6 He that
saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,

saith he is in the light,
hateth his brother,

loveth his brother abideth in the light,

he is righteous,
every one that
doeth righteousness is born of him.
3:1 Behold,
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
we should be called the sons of God:
therefore the world knoweth us
because it knew him not.
3:2 Beloved,
now are we the sons of God,
it doth not yet appear
what we shall be:
but we know that,
he shall appear,
like him;
for we shall see him as he is.
3:10 In this the children of God are manifest,
the children of the
devil:
whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
neither he
loveth not his brother.
3:11 For this is the message that
ye heard from the beginning,
should love one another.

who was of that
wicked one,

And wherefore slew he him?

my brethren,
if the world hate you.

we have passed from death unto life,
because we love
the brethren.

3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer:
no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God,
because he laid down his life
for us:
we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
3:17 But whoso hath this world's good,
seeth his brother have
need,
shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him,
how dwelleth
the love of God in him?
3:18 My little children,
let us not love in
word,
neither in tongue;
but in deed and
in truth.
3:19 And hereby we know that
we are of the truth,
shall assure our

God is greater than our heart,
knoweth all things.
3:21 Beloved,
if our heart condemn us not,
then have we confidence
toward God.
3:22 And whatsoever we ask,
we receive of him,
because we keep his
commandments,
do those things that
are pleasing in his sight.

That we should believe on the name
of his Son Jesus Christ,

keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him,

they are of God:
because many false prophets are gone out into the

4:7 Beloved,
let us love one another:
for love is of God;
every
one that
loveth is born of God,
knoweth God.
4:8 He that
loveth not knoweth not God;
for God is love.

4:11 Beloved,
if God so loved us,
we ought also to love one another.
4:12 No man hath seen God at any time.
If we love one another,

his love is perfected in us.
4:13 Hereby know we that
we dwell in him,

hath given us of his Spirit.

4:17 Herein is our love made perfect,

but perfect love casteth out fear:
because fear hath torment.

because he first loved us.
4:20 If a man say,
I love God,
he is a liar:
loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
how can he love
God whom he hath not seen?

That he who loveth God love his brother also.
5:1 Whosoever believeth that
Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
loveth him that
begat loveth him also that
is begotten
of him.
5:2 By this we know that
we love the children of God,
we love

said unto him,
he said,
Behold,
here I am.
22:2 And he said,
Take now thy son,
thine only son Isaac,
whom thou
lovest,
get thee into the land
of Moriah;
offer him there for
a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning,
saddled his ass,

he had done.
24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,
took
Rebekah,
she became his wife;
he loved her:
Isaac was
comforted after his mother's death.
25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife,
her name was Keturah.
25:27 And the boys grew:
Esau was a cunning hunter,
a man of the
field;
Jacob was a plain man,
dwelling in tents.
25:28 And Isaac loved Esau,
because he did eat of his venison:
but
Rebekah loved Jacob.

Esau came from the field,
he was

I pray thee,

Isaac spake to Esau his son.

the goats;
I will make them savoury meat for thy father,

he loveth:

brought them to his mother:
his mother made savoury meat,
such as his father loved.

which
were with her in the house,
put them upon Jacob her younger son:

but Rachel was beautiful and
well
favoured.
29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel;
said,
I will serve thee seven years
for Rachel thy younger daughter.
29:19 And Laban said,
It is better that
I give her to thee,
than that
I should give her to another man:
abide with me.
29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel;
they seemed unto
him but a few days,
for the love he had to her.
29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban,
Give me my wife,
for my days are
fulfilled,
I may go in unto her.
29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be
her maid.
29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel,
he loved also Rachel more
than Leah,

the LORD saw that
Leah was hated,

119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
commandments.
119:132 Look thou upon me,
be merciful unto me,
as thou usest to
do unto those that
love thy name.
119:133 Order my steps in thy word:
let not any iniquity have
dominion over me.
119:139 My zeal hath consumed me,
because mine enemies have forgotten
thy words.
119:140 Thy word is very pure:
therefore thy servant loveth it.
119:141 I am small and
despised:
yet do not I forget thy precepts.
119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
119:158 I beheld the transgressors,
was grieved;
because they kept
not thy word.
119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts:
quicken me,
according to thy lovingkindness.
119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning:
every one of thy
standeth in awe of thy word.
119:162 I rejoice at thy word,
as one that
findeth great spoil.
119:163 I hate and
abhor lying:
119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law:
nothing shall
offend them.
119:166 LORD,
I have hoped for thy salvation,
done thy

I love them

119:168 I have kept thy precepts and
thy testimonies:

to sit up late,

bread of sorrows:

127:3 Lo,
children are an heritage of the LORD:
the fruit of the
womb is his reward.
145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that
he also will
hear their cry,
will save them.

love him:
but all the wicked
will he destroy.

let all flesh
The LORD looseth the prisoners:

the LORD raiseth them

the LORD loveth the righteous:

he relieveth the fatherless
but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

in the openings of
the gates:
in the city she uttereth her words,

ye simple ones,
will ye love simplicity?
the scorners delight in
their scorning,
fools hate knowledge?
thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
3:11 My son,
despise not the chastening of the LORD;
neither be weary
of his correction:
3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth;
as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
3:13 Happy is the man that
findeth wisdom,
the man that
getteth
understanding.
4:2 For I give you good doctrine,
forsake ye not my law.
4:3 For I was my father's son,
tender and
only beloved in the sight of
my mother.
4:4 He taught me also,
said unto me,
Let thine heart retain my

7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,
aloes,

7:18 Come,
let us take our fill of love until the morning:
let us
solace ourselves with loves.

he is gone a long journey:

He hath taken a bag of money with him,

princes decree justice.
8:16 By me princes rule,
nobles,
even all the judges of the earth.

seek me early shall find

honour are with me;

I will fill their treasures.

sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:
all they

9:1 Wisdom hath builded her house,
she hath hewn out her seven
pillars:
9:2 She hath killed her beasts;
she hath mingled her wine;
rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
9:8 Reprove not a scorner,
lest he hate thee:
rebuke a wise man,
he will love thee.
9:9 Give instruction to a wise man,
he will be yet wiser:
teach a
just man,
he will increase in learning.
10:11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life:
but violence
covereth the mouth of the wicked.
10:12 Hatred stirreth up strifes:
but love covereth all sins.
10:13 In the lips of him that
hath understanding wisdom is found:
a rod is for the back of him that
is void of understanding.
11:31 Behold,
the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth:
much
more the wicked and
the sinner.
12:1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge:
but he that
hateth
reproof is brutish.
12:2 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD:
but a man of wicked

but there is that

destroyed for want of judgment.
13:24 He that
spareth his rod hateth his son:
loveth him
chasteneth him betimes.
13:25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul:
the prayer of the upright is his delight.
15:9 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:
but he
loveth him that
followeth after righteousness.
15:10 Correction is grievous unto him that
forsaketh the way:
hateth reproof shall die.
15:11 Hell and
destruction are before the LORD:
how much more then the
hearts of the children of men?
15:12 A scorner loveth not one that
reproveth him:
neither will he go unto the wise.

is slow to anger
16:12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness:
throne is established by righteousness.
16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings;
they love him that
speaketh right.
16:14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death:
but a wise man
17:8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that
hath it:
whithersoever it turneth,
it prospereth.
17:9 He that
covereth a transgression seeketh love;
repeateth a matter separateth very friends.
17:10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes
17:16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand
of a fool to get wisdom,
seeing he hath no heart to it?

a brother is born for adversity.

becometh surety
in the presence of his friend.

anger is outrageous;
but who is able to stand
before envy?
27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.
27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
but the kisses of an enemy
are deceitful.
29:2 When the righteous are in authority,
the people rejoice:
but when

worketh in that
wherein he laboureth?

for thy love is
better than wine.
1:3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
ointment poured forth,
therefore do the virgins love thee.

we will run after thee:
the king hath brought me into his
chambers:
we will be glad and
rejoice in thee,
we will remember thy
love more than wine:
the upright love thee.

my mother's children were angry with me;
they made me the
keeper of the vineyards;
but mine own vineyard have I not kept.
1:7 Tell me,
O thou whom my soul loveth,
where thou feedest,
where
thou makest thy flock to rest at noon:
for why should I be as one that
turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
O thou fairest among women,
go thy way forth by the footsteps of the
flock,
feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.
1:9 I have compared thee,
O my love,
to a company of horses in
Pharaoh's chariots.
1:10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels,
thy neck with chains

1:13 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me;

thou art fair,
my love;

doves' eyes.
1:16 Behold,
my beloved,
pleasant:
also our bed is
green.
1:17 The beams of our house are cedar,
our rafters of fir.
2:1 I am the rose of Sharon,
the lily of the valleys.
2:2 As the lily among thorns,
so is my love among the daughters.
2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,
so is my beloved
among the sons.
I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
his fruit was sweet to my taste.
2:4 He brought me to the banqueting house,
his banner over me was

by the

nor awake my love,
till he
please.
2:8 The voice of my beloved!
he cometh leaping upon the
mountains,
skipping upon the hills.
2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:
he standeth
behind our wall,
he looketh forth at the windows,
shewing himself
through the lattice.
2:10 My beloved spake,
Rise up,
my fair
one,
come away.

lo,
the winter is past,
the rain is over and
gone;

the little foxes,
spoil the vines:
our vines have tender grapes.
2:16 My beloved is mine,
I am his:
he feedeth among the lilies.
2:17 Until the day break,
the shadows flee away,
turn,
be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
3:1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth:
I sought him,
but I found him not.
3:2 I will rise now,
go about the city in the streets,
in the
broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth:
but I
found him not.
3:3 The watchmen that
go about the city found me:
to whom I said,
Saw
ye him whom my soul loveth?
3:4 It was but a little that
I passed
from them,
but I found him whom my soul loveth:
I held him,
would
not let him go,
until I had brought him into my mother's house,
into the chamber of her that
conceived me.
3:5 I charge you,
3:6 Who is this that
cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of

the bottom thereof of

the midst thereof being paved with
for the daughters of Jerusalem.
3:11 Go forth,
O ye daughters of Zion,
behold king Solomon with
the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
espousals,
in the day of the gladness of his heart.
4:1 Behold,
doves' eyes within thy locks:
thy hair is as a flock of goats,
appear from mount Gilead.
4:6 Until the day break,
I will get me to
the mountain of myrrh,
to the hill of frankincense.
4:7 Thou art all fair,
there is no spot in thee.
4:8 Come with me from Lebanon,
my spouse,
with me from Lebanon:
look
from the top of Amana,
from the top of Shenir and
Hermon,
from the
4:9 Thou hast ravished my heart,
my sister,
ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
with one chain of thy neck.
4:10 How fair is thy love,
how much better is
thy love than wine!
the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
4:11 Thy lips,
O my spouse,
drop as the honeycomb:
honey and
milk are
4:16 Awake,
O north wind;
come,
thou south;
blow upon my garden,
the spices thereof may flow out.
Let my beloved come into his
garden,
eat his pleasant fruits.
5:1 I am come into my garden,
I have gathered my
myrrh with my spice;
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
I have
drunk my wine with my milk:
O friends;
drink,
abundantly,
O beloved.
5:2 I sleep,
but my heart waketh:
it is the voice of my beloved that
knocketh,
Open to me,
my dove,
undefiled:
for my head is filled with dew,
my locks with the drops
of the night.
I have washed my
how shall I defile them?
5:4 My beloved put in his hand
hole of the door,
my bowels were moved for him.
5:5 I rose up to open to my beloved;
my hands dropped with myrrh,
my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh,
upon the handles of the
lock.
5:6 I opened to my beloved;
but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
was gone:
my soul failed when
he spake:
but I could not
find him;
I called him,
but he gave me no answer.
5:7 The watchmen that
went about the city found me,
they smote me,
they wounded me;
the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
5:8 I charge you,
O daughters of Jerusalem,
if ye find my beloved,
ye tell him,
I am sick of love.
5:9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
O thou fairest
among women?
what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
dost so charge us?
5:10 My beloved is white and
ruddy,
the chiefest
among ten thousand.
5:11 His head is as the most fine gold,
his locks are bushy,
black
5:15 His legs are as pillars of marble,
set upon sockets of fine gold:
his countenance is as Lebanon,
excellent as the cedars.
5:16 His mouth is most sweet:
he is altogether lovely.
This is my
beloved,
this is my friend,
6:1 Whither is thy beloved gone,
whither
is thy beloved turned aside?
we may seek him with thee.
6:2 My beloved is gone down into his garden,
to the beds of spices,
feed in the gardens,
to gather lilies.
6:3 I am my beloved's,
my beloved is mine:
he feedeth among the
lilies.
6:4 Thou art beautiful,
as Tirzah,
comely as Jerusalem,
terrible as an army with banners.
6:5 Turn away thine eyes from me,
for they have overcome me:
thy hair
7:5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel,
the hair of thine head
like purple;
the king is held in the galleries.
7:6 How fair and
how pleasant art thou,
O love,
for delights!
7:7
This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
thy breasts to clusters
boughs thereof:
now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,
the smell of thy nose like apples;
7:9 And the roof of thy mouth
like the best wine for my beloved,
goeth down sweetly,
causing
the lips of those that
are asleep to speak.
7:10 I am my beloved's,
his desire is toward me.
7:11 Come,
let us go forth into the field;
let us lodge in
the villages.
7:12 Let us get up early to the vineyards;
let us see if the vine
flourish,
whether the tender grape appear,
the pomegranates bud
forth:
there will I give thee my loves.
7:13 The mandrakes give a smell,
at our gates are all manner of
pleasant fruits,
new and
old,
which I have laid up for thee,
O my

thou wert as my brother,
sucked the breasts of my
mother!

8:4 I charge you,
nor
awake my love,
until he please.
8:5 Who is this that
cometh up from the wilderness,
leaning upon her
I raised thee up under the apple tree:
there thy mother
brought thee forth:
there she brought thee forth that
bare thee.
8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
as a seal upon thine arm:
love is strong as death;
jealousy is cruel as the grave:
the coals
thereof are coals of fire,
which hath a most vehement flame.
8:7 Many waters cannot quench love,
neither can the floods drown it:
if a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
it would
utterly be contemned.
8:8 We have a little sister,
she hath no breasts:
what shall we do
8:13 Thou that
dwellest in the gardens,
the companions hearken to thy
voice:
cause me to hear it.
8:14 Make haste,
be thou like to a roe or to a young
hart upon the mountains of spices.

for a covert from storm and

5:1 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching
his vineyard.
My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
5:2 And he fenced it,
gathered out the stones thereof,
planted
it with the choicest vine,
built a tower in the midst of it,
38:16 O LORD,
by these things men live,
in all these things is the
life of my spirit:
so wilt thou recover me,
make me to live.

for peace I had great bitterness:
but thou hast in love
to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption:
for thou hast cast
all my sins behind thy back.

Ethiopia and
Seba for thee.
43:4 Since thou wast precious in my sight,
thou hast been honourable,
I have loved thee:
therefore will I give men for thee,
for thy life.
43:5 Fear not:
for I am with thee:
I will bring thy seed from the

assemble yourselves,

which among them hath
declared these things?
The LORD hath loved him:
he will do his
pleasure on Babylon,
his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.
48:15 I,
even I,
have spoken;
I have called him:
I have brought
them an everlasting name,

56:6 Also the sons of the stranger,
join themselves to the LORD,
to serve him,
to love the name of the LORD,
to be his servants,
every one that
keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
taketh hold
of my covenant;
56:7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain,

for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me,
art gone up;
thou hast enlarged thy bed,
made thee a covenant with

didst increase
thy perfumes,
didst send thy messengers far off,

therefore in their land

I hate robbery for burnt offering;

I will make an everlasting
covenant with them.

There is no hope:

after them will I go.

4:31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,
5:30 A wonderful and
horrible thing is committed in the land;
5:31 The prophets prophesy
falsely,
the priests bear rule by their means;
my people love
to have it so:
what will ye do in the end thereof?
6:1 O ye
inhabitants of Jerusalem,
out of their graves:
8:2 And they shall
spread them before the sun,
the moon,
all the host of heaven,
whom they have loved,
whom they have served,
after whom they
have walked,
whom they have sought,
whom they have worshipped:
they shall not be gathered,
nor be buried;

We gathered 1 1
different varieties together - plus two pairs of
skates on to whip up some ice,
which was then swept up for
our tests.
To compare the gloves’ dexterity we tied knots,
fastened
a lifejacket buckle and
attempted basic tasks on smartphone touch-
screens.
We tested how easy the gloves were to pull on and
off with wet
hands,
whether they kept hands dry after two minutes plunged into an icy
bucket of water.
To test insulation properties,
we tucked similarly-sized ice cubes
into the index finger of each glove and
timed how long they took to melt.
We also timed
an ice cube melting at room temperature - it takes longer than you might imagine!
Similarly,
Jack’s bowline knot-tying time
was initially 4.
5 seconds without gloves,
but after completing a dozen knots with gloves on his non-gloved time
had reduced to 3.
4 seconds.
As a comparison,
Ben’s bowline took an average of 3 seconds without gloves.

many of the public things I love about the
city often rest on some highly questionable political,
social,
or economic
private scaffolding.
I accept this as the paradox of modern life.
And love it.
Take Central Park — as handmade as anyplace in the city,
but one in which I
still feel like I’m in nature.
I love drifting there,
being alone in crowds,
not

me a primordial outcropping,
under a tree,
near a path.

The new spaces are not for dreaming.

or
anything unknown.
At night,
these gussied-up spaces are for whatever
personal crisis,

I pass a hillock around 67th Street
where I remember breaking up forever with a lover;
elsewhere,
I remember coming
undone after a woman told me we were through and
came into such close contact
with me that
I thought I'd die.
Should we talk about going into the park to
gather ourselves after visiting doctors or loved ones in hospitals?
Perhaps only
to say that
this is all but unimaginable on the High Line or Culture Shed and
Insiders.
It turns
out that
I love art in public places,
but only when
the art is not picked in any
public democratic way.
That means the High Line got this right.

Few artists reward prolonged scrutiny more than Matisse,

in scrutinizing
him,
a beautiful paradox arises:
The Cut-Outs are some of the easiest great
works to love in the history of Western art.
Yet they contain some of the most
complex spatial architectonics in all of art.

Once an hour or so,
two young male singers step onto the steps,
moving
about the gallery while singing insults to one another.
The music is lovely and
original;
the performance lasts about 12 minutes.
The rest of the time,
the
insults are culled from sources from Cicero and
Shakespeare to recent films and
politics.
And the voices are angelic — I loved listening to them.
Even though
you can only make out a few syllables here and
there,
some of the jibes are
other people’s art.
The saddest part is that
by now,
this may be what new
audiences have been trained to see and
love.

It's all just facts

add up to the doom that
awaits these lovers.

It is one of the most visually literate works
ever made,
by one of the most articulate artists who ever lived.
I love Rauschenberg.
I love that
he created a turning point in visual history,
that
he redefined the idea of beauty,
he combined painting,
sculpture,
photography,
and
everyday life with such gall,
he was interested in,
as
he put it,
the ability to conceive failure as progress.
Most of all,
I love
him for his fecundity and
fearlessness.

Damien Hirst not only makes vitrines straight out of Bacon he puts meat and
carcasses in them.

Munch,
Bacon is an artist we love when
young.

angst,
weirdness,

You might have reconsidered feeling like Bacon if you’d lived in his skin.

degradation.

often remarked understandable,
given his adolescence.
Auden called a bugger’s daydream.
Endless liaisons with rent boys and
society types followed,
until Bacon’s
predator-prey notion of love and
his desire to suffer reached new heights,
in
1952.
At the age of 43,
he met a former RAF pilot,
Peter Lacy,
in London’s Soho.
They spent a lot of time in Tangier,
a refuge for gay men looking for freedom.
I’d never really fallen in love with anyone until then,
Bacon said.
Of
course,
it was the most total disaster from the start.
Bacon couldn’t live with
or without him:
Being in love in that
extreme way,
he said,
being totally
obsessed by someone,
is like having some dreadful disease.
I wouldn’t wish it on
Bacon,
then 61,
was again devastated.
No wonder he
talked about the destruction of love.

The silky seduction of her generic paintings of generic

probably are a misfit.

monument to Pushkin in Moscow and
he was received with extraordinary
demonstrations of love and

A few months later Dostoevsky died.
He was followed to the grave by a

the roles
were inverted;
for while the lady was as much in love as the Duc de
Vitry,
the answering devotion professed by the notary was as insincere
as the disinterested attachment to her lover displayed by the whilom
maid of honour.
Maitre Quennebert was still young and
of attractive appearance,
to understand
the marked advances of the widow,
he treated her with
a reserve and
respect she would fain have dispensed with,
sometimes made her doubt of his love.
But it was impossible for her as a

Seizing one of her hands,
the chevalier covered it with passionate
kisses.

led is exposed:

CHAPTER V
Chevalier de Moranges had,
gained admittance,
she declared,
under the
pretext that
he brought her news from the duke,
the one man who occupied
her thoughts,
the sole object of her love.

She had been induced,

to listen to people who
had led her to suppose they could give her news of one so dear to her as
the duke.

but Charlotte was young and

mystery surrounding their
connection gave it piquancy.

who had no love affair on hand,

days,

She faithfully treasured up the memory of his words of passion,
his looks of love,
the warmth of his caresses,
although at first she
struggled hard to chase his image from her heart.
But as the Due de
Vitry assured her that
he had killed him on the spot,
she considered it
no breach of faith to think lovingly of the dead,
while she took the
goods so bounteously provided by her living lover,
her gentlest
thoughts,
her most enduring regrets,
were given to one whom she never
hoped to see again.

though
only of secondary importance,
can no longer be left behind the scenes.
We have already said that
the loves of Quennebert and
Madame Rapally
were regarded with a jealous eye by a distant cousin of the lady’s late
husband.
The love of this rejected suitor,
whose name was Trumeau,
no more sincere than the notary’s,
nor were his motives more honourable.
Although his personal appearance was not such as to lead him to expect
self before the widow,
she vouchsafed him not one glance.
Her heart was
filled with the love of his rival,
it is no easy thing to tear a
rooted passion out of a widow’s heart when
widow’s age is
forty-six,
she is silly enough to believe that
the admiration she
Trumeau found to his cost.
All his carefully prepared declarations of
all his skilful insinuations against Quennebert,
brought him
nothing but scornful rebuffs.
But Trumeau was nothing if not
to speak the truth,
I have no great reason to like him.
If it
were not for him,
I should perhaps have been happy to-day;
my love might
have moved your heart.
I have become resigned to my loss,
such a benevolent mood.
You must not be vexed because I could not give
you the kind of love you wanted;
the heart,
is not amenable to
reason.
"There is only one thing I should like to ask.
You are saying to yourself that
because of my ill-success with
you I am trying to injure him;
but what if I could prove that
he does
not love you as much as he pretends—?
"Come,
control your naughty tongue!
Are you going to begin

I say,
’This gallant wooer of widows does not
love you for yourself but for your money-bags.
He fools you by fine
promises,
but as to marrying you—never,
I shall make no protestations,
shall let the future show how sincere is my devotion to your interests.
Madame Rapally was too happy,
too certain of being loved,
not to pardon
easily.
With the self-complacency and
factitious generosity of a woman
who feels herself the object of two violent passions,
she was so good as
to feel pity for the lover who was left out in the cold,
offered him
her hand.

triumphantly.
The platonic love of Angelique de Guerchi for the handsome Chevalier de
Moranges had resulted,
as we have seen,
in no practical wrong to the Duc
de Vitry.
After her reconciliation with her lover,
brought about by the
eminently satisfactory explanations she was able to give of her conduct,
which we have already laid before our readers,
she did not consider it

For a long time past the young
lady-in-waiting had perceived that

lost the love of Joan;
for his tyranny had indeed become more
unendurable to her than her husband’s.

And as the quondam

so madly,
the Catanese congratulated herself on the success of her
infamy,
believing that
she held her prey so fast in her toils that

A year passed by before Joan,
conquered by her infatuation,

brotherly intimacy,
of blind submission,
of unswerving devotion;
perhaps he would have deceived his mistress for a longer time had not
of Artois fallen madly in love with Joan.
Suddenly the bandage
fell from the young girl’s eyes;
comparing the two with the natural
instinct of a woman beloved which never goes astray,
she perceived that
Robert of Cabane loved her for his own sake,
while Bertrand
of Artois
would give his life to make her happy.
A light fell upon her past:
mentally recalled the circumstances that
preceded and
accompanied her
earliest love;
a shudder went through her at the thought that
had been sacrificed to a cowardly seducer by the very woman she had
loved most in the world,
whom she had called by the name of mother.
Joan drew back into herself,
wept bitterly.
Wounded by a single blow
in all her affections,
at first her grief absorbed her;
roused to
sudden anger,
she proudly raised her head,
for now her love was changed
to scorn.
Robert,
amazed at her cold and
haughty reception of him,
following on so great a love,
was stung by jealousy and
wounded pride.
He broke out into bitter reproach and
violent recrimination,
letting fall the mask,
once for all lost his place in Joan’s heart.
His mother at last saw that
it was time to interfere:
she rebuked her
son,
accusing him of upsetting all her plans by his clumsiness.
"As you have failed to conquer her by love," she said,
"you must now
subdue her by fear.

"Now,

I have come in the name of all the care I bestowed on
your infancy,
of all the maternal love I have lavished on you,

my family will remember for evermore.
The queen recoiled one step,
crimson with astonishment and
rage;
up to Bertrand,
who had angrily drawn his dagger,
would have fallen
upon the two favourites to take vengeance for the insults they had
offered to the queen;
but he was very soon disarmed by the lovely
shining eyes raised to him in supplication,
the two arms cast about him,
the tears shed by Joan:
he fell at her feet and
kissed them
rapturously,
with no thought of seeking excuse for his presence,
with no
word of love,
for it was as if they had loved always:
he lavished the
tenderest caresses on her,
dried her tears,
pressed his trembling
lips upon her lovely head.
Joan began to forget her anger,
her vows,
her repentance:
soothed by the music of her lover’s speech,
she returned
uncomprehending monosyllables:
her heart beat till it felt like
breaking,
once more she was falling beneath love’s resistless spell,
a new interruption occurred,
shaking her roughly out of her
ecstasy;
but this time the young count was able to pass quietly and

All this Carter grasped,
though the images bore no fixed relation to one another or to him.
He himself had no stable form or position,

position as his whirling fancy supplied.
He had wished to find the enchanted regions of his boyhood dreams,
where galleys Sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran,
and
elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kied,
beyond forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns that
sleep lovely and
unbroken under the moon.
Now,
intoxicated with wider visions,
he scarcely knew what he sought Thoughts of infinite and
blasphemous daring rose in his mind,
he knew he would face the dreaded Guide without fear,
asking monstrous and
terrible things of him.

limitless Mind a flood of knowledge and
explanation which opened new vistas to the seeker,

He was told how childish and

what an infinity of directions there are besides the known direc-tions of up-down,

their craving for praise and

their demands for faiths contrary to reason and

Hey,

First,
I love SR.
It was the first system I was introduced to,
the one I’m

You may not love it … Or even like

As someone who loves,

is a big fan of 3e,
I can totally still see your points
here.
Some of the rules are just stupid and
useless,
5e in particular seems to be very obtuse in the rules and
the heavy maths this game requires,
a lot of it is actually composed of coherent rules
(if not overly intricate
mathematics).
And I really love the feel of Shadowrun in general.
But the main book is the worst mess I ever saw
in all my experience.

--Of Love and
of Women
To judge love by most of its effects,
it seems more like hatred than
kindness.
In love we often doubt of what we most believe.
As long as we love,
we forgive.
Love is like fire,
it cannot be without continual motion;
as soon as it
ceases to hope or fear it ceases to exist.
Many persons would never have been in love had they never heard talk of
Agreeable and
pleasant as love is,
it pleases more by the manners in
which it shows itself than by itself alone.
We pass on from love to ambition;
we seldom return from ambition to
Those who have had a great love affair find themselves all their life
happy and
unhappy at being cured of it.
In love the one who is first cured is best cured.
The reason why lovers are never weary of talking of each other is that
they are always talking of themselves.
Constancy in love is a perpetual inconstancy which makes our heart
attach itself in succession to all the qualities of our beloved,
prefer,
now this trait and
now that;
this constancy is only a
kind of inconstancy fixed and
enclosed in a single object.
If there is a love pure and
exempt from all mixture with our other
passions,
it is that
which is hidden in the depth of our heart and
unknown to ourselves.
The pleasure of love consists in loving,
our own passion gives us
more happiness than the feelings which our beloved has for us.
The grace of novelty is to love like the fine bloom on fruit;
it gives
it a lustre which is easily effaced and
never recovered.
We are nearer loving those who hate us than those who love us more than
we desire.
Women often fancy themselves to be in love when
they are not.
Their
natural passion for being beloved,
their unwillingness to give a
denial,
the excitement of mind produced by an affair of gallantry,
these make them imagine they are in love when
they are in fact only
coquetting.
All women are flirts.
Some are restrained by timidity and
some by
reason.
The greatest miracle of love is the reformation of a coquette.
A coquette pretends to be jealous of her lover,
in order to conceal her
envy of other women.
Most women yield more from weakness than from passion,
hence an
enterprising man usually succeeds with them better than an amiable man.
It is harder for women to overcome their coquetry than their love.
No
woman knows how much of a coquette she is.
Women who are in love more readily forgive great indiscretions than
small infidelities.
Some people are so full of themselves that
they become lovers
they find a way of being occupied with their passion without being
interested in the person whom they love.
It is useless to be young without being beautiful,
or beautiful without
being young.
In their first love affairs women love their lover;
in all others they
love love.
In the old age of love,
as in the old age of life,
we continue to live
to pain long after we have ceased to live to pleasure.
There is no passion in which self-love reigns so powerfully as in love;
we are always more ready to sacrifice the repose of a person we love
than to lose our own.
There is a certain kind of love which,
as it grows excessive,
leaves no
room for jealousy.
Jealousy is born with love,
but it does not always die with it.
Jealousy is the greatest of all afflictions,
which least
excites pity in the persons that
cause it.
In love and
in friendship we are often happier by reason of the things
we do not know than by those that
we do.
There are few women whose merit lasts longer than their beauty.
The reason why most women are little touched by friendship is that
friendship is insipid to those who have felt what love is.
II.
In the misfortunes of our best friends we always find something that
does not displease us.
Rare as true love is,
it is less rare than true friendship.
What makes us so changing in our friendships is that
it is difficult to
discern the qualities of the soul,
easy to recognize the qualities
It is equally difficult to have a friendship for those whom we do not
esteem as for those we esteem more than ourselves.
We love those who admire us,
not those whom we admire.
Most of the friendships of the world ill deserve the name of
a man may make occasional use of them,
as in a
It is more dishonourable to mistrust a friend than to be deceived by

We are fond of exaggerating the love our friends bear us,
but it is
less from a feeling of gratitude than from a desire to advertise our
own merits.
people,
what passes for it is only a subtle dissimulation used to
attract confidence.
We can love nothing except in relation to ourselves,
we merely
follow our own bent and
pleasure when
we prefer our friends to
ourselves;
yet it is only by this preference that
friendship can be
made true and
perfect.
It seems as if self-love is the dupe of kindness and
forgotten while we are working for the benefit of other men.
In this
case,
our self-love is merely taking the safest road to arrive
at its ends;
it is lending at usury under the pretext of giving,
aiming at winning all the world by subtle and
delicate means.
The first impulses of joy excited in us by the good fortune of our
friends proceed neither from our good nature nor from the friendship
we have for them;
it is an effect of self-love that
flatters us with
the hope either of being fortunate in our turn or of drawing some
advantage from their prosperity.

we lack more than the means.
It is a mistake to imagine that

Idleness often masters

Good manners are the least of all laws and

which we are flattered.
Flattery is a kind of bad money to which our vanity gives currency.
Self-love,
as it happens to be well or ill-conducted,
constitutes
virtue and
vice.
We are so prepossessed in our own favour that
we often mistake for
virtues those vices that
bear some resemblance to them,
artfully disguised by self-love.
Nothing is so capable of lessening our self-love as the observation
we disapprove at one time what we approve at another.
Self-love is the love of self,
of everything for the sake of self.
When fortune gives the means,
self-love makes men idolise themselves
tyrannise over others.
It never rests or fixes itself anywhere
invisible even to itself;
there it conceives,
breeds,
cherishes,
without being aware of it,
an infinity of likings and
hatreds;

of which are so monstrous that,
having given birth to them,
either does not recognize them,
or cannot bear to own them.
From the
darkness which covers self-love spring the ridiculous notions which it
entertains of itself;
thence its errors,
ignorance,
silly mistakes;
thence it imagines that
its feelings are dead when
they are but asleep;
It is inconstant;
numberless are the changes,
besides those which
happen from external causes,
which proceed from its own nature.

through love,
through novelty,

satiety,
through disgust,
through inconstancy itself.

One of the finest poems by Willis--the very best,
in my opinion,
She kept with chary care.
She kept with care her beauties rare
From lovers warm and
true,--
For her heart was cold to all but gold,
And the rich came not to woo,--
No mercy now can clear her brow
For this world's peace to pray;
as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,
Her woman's heart gave way!
Stand
in their beauty by.
The oriole should build and
tell
His love-tale,
close beside my cell;
The idle butterfly
Should rest him there,

With fairy laughter blent?
And what,
if in the evening light,
Betrothèd lovers walk in sight
Of my low monument?
I would the lovely scene around
Might know no sadder sight nor sound.
I know that
I no more should see
Nor its wild music flow;
But if,
around my place of sleep,
The friends I love should come to weep,
They might not haste to go.

"The Haunted House," by the same author,
is one of the truest poems

It never hath found but in thee .
Then when
nature around me is smiling,
Though human,
thou didst not deceive me;
Though woman,
thou didst not forsake;
Though loved,
thou forborest to grieve me;
Though slandered,
thou never couldst shake;
Though trusted,
thou didst not disclaim me;
It is the soul-elevating idea,

This ardent love it is--this proud,

Egotism is a
passionate and
exaggerated love of self,
which leads a man to connect
everything with his own person,
to prefer himself to everything in
the world.

respects them:
he thinks he already sees his remote descendants,

loves them.

former and
the latter;
he will frequently sacrifice his personal

whatever natural repugnance may restrain men from acting in
concert,
they will always be ready to combine for the sake of a party.
Thus political life makes the love and
practice of association more
general;
it imparts a desire of union,
teaches the means of
combination to numbers of men who would have always lived apart.
Interest Rightly Understood

powerful individuals,

persons loved to entertain a lofty idea of the duties of man.
They were
fond of professing that
it is praiseworthy to forget one's self,

himself,
in order to gain eternal life;

middle classes:

spreads,

pleasures of material life.

channel,
sweeps everything along in its course.

Peculiar Effects Of The Love Of Physical Gratifications In
Democratic Ages
It may be supposed,
from what has just been said,
the love
of physical gratifications must constantly urge the Americans to
irregularities in morals,

threaten
The taste for physical gratifications leads a democratic people into no
such excesses.
The love of well-being is there displayed as a tenacious,
exclusive,
universal passion;
but its range is confined.
To build
Nor ought these facts to surprise us.

It is necessary that
all who feel an
interest in the future destinies of democratic society should unite,

If amongst the opinions of a democratic people any of those

belief,

I think that
it is only by scrupulous conformity to

they can hope to teach the

to love,
to observe it in the lesser
concerns of life.

That Excessive Care Of Worldly Welfare May Impair That

ambition should
be obliged to fix its gaze long upon an object before it is gratified.
Governments must apply themselves to restore to men that
love of the

the state of society no longer inspire

they must practically teach the community

if not wholly,
at least partially,

to work.
Even those who are principally actuated by the love of fame are
necessarily made familiar with the thought that
they are not exclusively
actuated by that
motive;
they discover that
the desire of getting
proportion as it is cultivated,
is increased by all the efforts made
to satiate it.
All the causes which make the love of worldly welfare
predominate in the heart of man are favorable to the growth of commerce
manufactures.
Amongst such
aristocracies there are hardly any desires which do not require wealth
to satisfy them;
the love of riches becomes,
so to speak,
the high road
of human passions,
which is crossed by or connected with all lesser
tracks.
The love of money and
the thirst for that
distinction which
attaches to power,
are then so closely intermixed in the same souls,
it becomes difficult to discover whether men grow covetous from
part.
They are therefore all led to engage in commerce,
not only for
the sake of the profit it holds out to them,
but for the love of the
constant excitement occasioned by that
pursuit.
The United States of America have only been emancipated for half a

rigorous performance of the

they do not claim their

When property becomes so fluctuating,

property so restless and
so ardent,
I cannot but fear that
men may
arrive at such a state as to regard every new theory as a peril,
of being moved too far.
I dread,
I confess it,
lest they should at
last so entirely give way to a cowardly love of present enjoyment,
as to
lose sight of the interests of their future selves and
of those of their
descendants;
to prefer to glide along the easy current of life,

When men
have at last learned to make a peaceful and

have freely submitted themselves to discipline--these same

But when
the officers of a democratic army have
no longer the love of war and
the ambition of arms,
nothing whatever
remains to them.
I am therefore of opinion that,

in democratic ages armies seem to grow larger
in proportion as the love of war declines.
In the same ages,
too,
the manner of carrying on war is likewise altered by the same causes.

Of all
the political effects produced by the equality of conditions,

of independence is the first to strike the observing,

I admire to see how it deposits in the mind

instinctive love of political

it is on this very account that
I am attached to it.
overgrow it.
[Footnote a:
See Appendix W.
I have also had occasion to show how the increasing love of well-being,
the fluctuating character of property,
cause democratic nations
to dread all violent disturbance.
The love of public tranquillity is
frequently the only passion which these nations retain,
it becomes
more active and
powerful amongst them in proportion as all other
insupportable does the sight of such a difference become.
Hence it is
natural that
the love of equality should constantly increase together
with equality itself,
it should grow by what it feeds upon.
This never-dying,
ever-kindling hatred,
which sets a democratic people
neighbor who is his equal;
he refuses to acknowledge in such a person
ability superior to his own;
he mistrusts his justice,
is jealous
of his power;
he fears and
he contemns him;
he loves continually to
remind him of the common dependence in which both of them stand
to the
same master.
its excesses and
its errors,
it is restored at the first call.
Democratic nations often hate those in whose hands the central power is
vested;
but they always love that
power itself.
Thus,
by two separate paths,
I have reached the same conclusion.
I have
rapid and
constant amongst those democratic nations which are exposed by
their position to great and
frequent wars,
than amongst all others.
I have shown how the dread of disturbance and
the love of well-being
insensibly lead democratic nations to increase the functions of
central government,
as the only power which appears to be intrinsically
has shaken all belief,
filled the nation with fierce hatreds,
conflicting interests,
contending factions.
The love of public
tranquillity becomes at such times an indiscriminating passion,
members of the community are apt to conceive a most inordinate devotion
The foremost or
indeed the sole condition which is required in order to succeed in
centralizing the supreme power in a democratic community,
is to love
or to get men to believe you love it.
Thus the science of
despotism,
which was once so complex,
is simplified,
reduced as it
following two separate roads to servitude:
the taste for their own
welfare withholds them from taking a part in the government,
love of that
welfare places them in closer dependence upon those who
govern.
The central power not only fulfils of itself the whole of the duties
overturn or to coerce the established powers.
This led them to make
revolutions,
breathed into many of them,
fierce love of
disturbance and
which all revolutions,
whatever be their
object,
always engender.
Despotism therefore appears to me peculiarly to
be dreaded in democratic ages.
I should have loved freedom,
I believe,
at all times,
but in the time in which we live I am ready to worship
inclinations,
since those inclinations change from age to age;
but upon
more elevated principles and
a more general experience.
The love which a
people may show for its law proves only this:--that
we should not be in
too great a hurry to change them.
of danger:
I am now about to point out another kind of peril,
more rare
indeed,
but far more formidable if it were ever to make its appearance.
If the love of physical gratification and
which are naturally suggested to men by a state of equality,
were to
get entire possession of the mind of a democratic people,
to fill it
completely,
the manners of the nation would become so totally opposed to
military tastes,
perhaps even the army would eventually acquire
a love of peace,
in spite of the peculiar interest which leads it to
desire war.

The Use and
Abuse of Gloves.
Never be tempted to throw away a pair of gloves,
however old.
That is,
until you have decided on their utter uselessness.
Because a glove has
holey fingers,
or a badly torn thumb,
or a split palm,
it does not
signify that
it is of no use except for house-work.
Our illustration will show what can be done with gloves that
are
“nearly hopeless” to most people.
To Mend a Glove worn Between the Fingers.
The first part to go is,
as a rule,
between the fingers.
This more
especially is the case with washing gloves,
which have a tendency to
shrink,
wash-leathers,
unless splice-seamed,
will always do this.
As the fingers shrink,
the space between splits,
it cannot be sewn
This forms bars about 1/16-inch apart,
with two button-hole
stitches in between.
This completed,
turn the glove and
do the same thing across from side
to side,
knotting the thread each time it crosses the under-threads.
By
this means,
a tiny net-work is made.
This net-work is elastic,
will wear and
wash into shape and
last as
long as the glove itself.
Making a Neat Patch.
Next to the fingers,
the thumb is the worst problem.
I find that
opening carriage doors has an unfortunate knack of
splitting a glove,
where the thumb joins the palm.
If there is plenty of room,
this split I can be neatly joined up,
but
the better plan is to patch it with a tiny piece of an old glove.
[Sidenote:
Taking Care of Your Gloves.
Tack the patch in,
then with fine silk the colour of the glove,
button-hole around the edge of the tear,
taking up the under-skin
as well.
possible.
Split up the seam and
lay it flat on the piece of leather or
kid which you are using to mend the glove.
Cut around the pattern,
leaving a tiny margin,
as your sewing is not as
fine as that
done by an expert.
Then tack the new thumb into the glove around the base.
Button-hole this carefully in,
lastly button-hole the seam up the
thumb and
across the top.
This will be found quite easy.
For coloured kid gloves,
I buy scraps of kid from the boot maker,
you can procure quite a nice sized piece for a small sum,
large enough
to cut any size thumb and
to leave a good few scraps for patching.
Always remember in putting on gloves to proceed slowly,
pulling on the
fingers first and
half the palm next,
the thumb last.
Be as careful in taking off as in putting on,
pull each finger and
save the busy housewife hours of darning and
patching later on.

forego these for a while,
now that
such items have become so expensive.
Those who are studying economy,
however,
will find an excellent
substitute for the leather,

It is always

go;
the remainder of the glove will be
a serviceable bit of kid.
These pieces can be used in a variety of
a chill—or more serious illness,—if you find a new thick winter coat
beyond your purse in these hard times.
Cut off the fingers and
thumb,
remove the fasteners,
cut the glove
up to the top at the front opening,
spread it out flat—as you
see in the small illustration.
There will be a little fulness at the
thumb-pieces,
but this can be doubled over and
stitched down flat.
Here is the piece of Glove with the fingers cut off.
This shows some of the gloves stitched on the flannel

Perhaps your thickest coat is not nearly thick enough for the piercing

in all probability you can

It is best to cultivate clover mainly for

Sowing clover and

is much practised.
The first year it will be nearly all clover,
second year mostly timothy.
But sown together,

spread even,
allow it to wilt,
the leaves and
smaller parts to dry;
then draw into the barn,
putting alternate loads
of clover and
dry straw into the mow,
salting the clover very lightly.
The clover is sometimes put in when
quite green,
salted sufficiently
to preserve it.
It is injurious to cattle,
by compelling them to eat
when
it stands within their reach;
too much salt in hay compels them to
eat more,
which engenders disease.
Clover cured as above makes the best
possible clover-hay,
if great care be used to prevent excessive salting.
Saving clover-seed is a matter of considerable importance.
The large red
clover is too late a variety to produce seed on a second crop the same

Of course affection isn't all up to one person — it's definitely a two way

So be ready to accept any forms of love that

Set Aside Time For Lovin'

participants related massages strongly to the degree of satisfaction

../1-txt/emo/5 Human Desires that Point to God _ Strange Notions.txt
------
That’s because through our human consciousness we desire five transcendental experiences,
none of which are necessary for survival.
These five
transcendental desires are our yearning for:
(1)
perfect knowledge/truth,
(2)
perfect love,
(3)
perfect justice/goodness,
(4)
perfect beauty,
and
(5)
perfect
home/being.
Most interestingly,
any earthly satisfaction of these five inner desires leaves us feeling frustrated and
wanting more.
That’s because what we desire is a
perfect experience of each of these five transcendental desires.
But,
since perfect knowledge/truth,
perfect home/being don’t exist here on earth,
why do we seek them?
It makes no sense for us to seek that
which is unattainable.
11/1/2017 5 Human Desires that
Point to God :
Strange Notions
Desire for Perfect Love
We humans also have a desire for perfect and
unconditional love.
However,
this desire can mislead us into expecting perfect love from another human
being.
When the relationship does not fulfill our desire for perfect love,
this expectation leads to frustration and
quite possibly to a decline in the
relationship.
For example,
as the imperfections in the love of our beloved manifest themselves
(e.
our spouse is not perfectly understanding,
kind,
forgiving,
self-giving,
concerned for me and
all my interests),
we at first become irritated.
This irritation often leads to frustration,
which in turn
becomes dashed expectations.
These dashed expectations may become either quiet hurt or overt demands,
both aimed at extracting a more perfect love from
our beloved.
When this perfect love does not happen,
thoughts of terminating the relationship may arise.
Why do we fall prey to such an obvious error?
Because our desire is for love to be perfect and
unconditional,
but the reality is otherwise.
We humans just
cannot satisfy each other’s desire for perfect and
no matter how hard we try.
Thus,
our dissatisfaction and
frustration arise out of a
conscious desire for a perfect love,
a love that
cannot be experienced in our relationships with others here on earth.
But what is the origin of our deep desire and
yearning for perfect love?
Why would we have this desire for perfect love,
especially as it just leaves us
feeling dissatisfied and
frustrated when
we cannot find it with another person?
Why do we have an awareness of and
desire for a type of love that
we have
neither known nor will experience from another human being?
It seems we are searching for perfect love in all the wrong places.
Our desire for perfect and
unconditional love can only be met by the Perfect Love
(God).
Again,
we find that
God has implanted in each of us a conscious desire for a perfect love that
only God can fulfill.
Desire for Perfect Justice/Goodness
In addition,
we have a conscious desire for perfect justice and
goodness.
The fifth transcendental is our desire to be at perfect harmony and
peace in our being and
in our world.
When our desire for perfect home is even partially
fulfilled,
theologians,
saints,
mystics throughout the ages have referred to this as joy,
love,
awe,
unity,
holiness,
and/or peace.
we need to ask
what gives rise to our desire for perfect harmony and
our yearning to feel comfortably at home in our world?

human endeavors.

we are in

so we are in constant contact with the

So,

I would discuss these nine types of aection with examples,
to
demonstrate how each is meaningful and
applicable to the needs,

fertility.
It
remains the most prevalent between men and
women alike.

Agape —is the most desirable and
most disarming,
because it is
unconditional and
seless to the core.
It is the true love;
is distinct
from realitas love I discuss below.
Some even liken it to spiritual love,
where one would do and
go beyond the interests of the self to do for the
others.
It is evident in innite empathy toward others.
Agape love is of a universal kindness toward humankind.
It is thus,
the
purest type of love.
It is free from sexual or amorous desires or
expectations.
It is the kind of love between parents and
children,
between family members,
irrespective of inherent aws,
failings or
shortcomings of the other.
forgiveness of the other aimed at the pursuit of the greatest good for
that
individual.
This type of love might not augur well for an employee who sees the
employer engaging in an untoward action that
violates the integrity of
other employees,
or that
violate the rules and
edicts that
govern ethical
expectations and
rules of corporate culture and
governance.

Therefore,
it would not be present in a competitive corporate settings.
But this type of aection would be tremendously needed and
applicable
to non-prot organizations and
charitable foundations,
where the love
for humanity and
the empowerment of persons remain paramount.
6.
Pragma —is an aged,
matured and
well- developed and
time-tested
love type.
It is the enduring love that
comes with means-ends

It is the type that

This is the kind of love and

conscientiously cultivate in their seasoned and
veteran employees.
These corporate veterans are ripened with institutional memories to
permanently the culture of particular corporations.
7.
Mania — is the obsessive love,
jealous,
an envious of the others in it.
One member becomes possessive and
controlling and
becomes totally
dependent,
in need of the other’s aection,
attention,
admiration,
This individual
usually has extremely low self-esteem and
dreads abandonment.

because they dene themselves in a partnership with the
other person they obsess about.
This love type has no place in corporate settings.
Management should
do all within its powers to foil any interactions or transactions with any
likelihood of this type of aection developing.

9.
Realitas — a real love without pretenses and

romanticism.
It is more accurate,

but living in a dreamland.
Realitas love forces the members to face the state of things as they
really are,
as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of things.
It must

or being unpatriotic.

love should be part of your life in work and

keep not only their relationship intact,
but also their relational partner satisfied?
Two studies have addressed this to some
degree by considering how one relational partner expresses love to the other
(i.
how to give positive moments through
various expressions of affection).
Verbal expressions.
A verbal expression of affection is anything that
could be said to or about the other person that
could
cause them to feel encouraged,
loved,
or validated.
This includes,
but is not limited to,
the obvious statement "I love you.
Many people long for this direct verbal expression of their spouse's feelings
(Chapman 1997).
The person who looks for verbal
achieved,
or verbal support of a spouse's goals or dreams.
Public praise or admiration of the spouse,
even if it is not said
directly to the spouse
(either it is overheard or relayed by a third party),
enhances the feelings of love felt by the recipient.
Quality time.
Whereas some people feel loved when
their spouse says positive things about them,
others appreciate the
second type of expression,
For example,
a husband
who feels most loved through quality time,
feels important
when
his wife takes time away from her other duties to spend time with him.
Or a wife might feel loved through a silent walk
on the beach.
The quality time does not need to be spent with the couple in seclusion,
although it could be spent that
way.
indicates that
there are many reasons why a person likes to receive gifts
(Areni,
Kieckner,
and
Palan 1998).
A wife who feels
loved by receiving gifts might be pleased because her husband
spent money when
it was totally out of character for him to do
so.
The giving of flowers to signify that
the spouse remembered a special day
(Mother's Day,
birthday,
or anniversary)

exertion of time and
energy for the other's benefit is key.
who feels loved by what his wife does for him would
experience the greatest feeling of love when
his wife fixes dinner or surprises him by mowing the lawn.
Likewise,
might express affection by changing soiled diapers or doing the laundry.
However,
the thought that
spouse would do something like this,
even though he or she does not particularly like to,
would make the other spouse feel
One researcher has indicated that
supportive behaviors include tangible support
acts of service)
through "offering
For instance,
cuddling,
hugging,
an arm
around the shoulder,
or even holding hands fulfills a person's desire to be touched without a sexual level of involvement.
These instances of touch let the other person know that
he or she is loved.
Touch is a symbolic behavior that
sends several
different messages.
Aggression,
as Villard and
Whipple
(1967)
use it,
seems paradoxical.
The goal of aggressive touch is not to
injure or cause harm to a person
(the very antithesis of love).
Instead,
aggression is affection that
might best be described as
"horse-play" or "rough-housing.
Messing up a spouse's hair or tugging at their clothing can likewise send
signals of affection.
Certainly,
acts of aggression come in various forms and
cease to express love if the other spouse feels,
in
any way,
violated as a result.

Wherefore - Marauder - art thou here?
Because,
Sir,
love IS sweet!
We are the Flower - Thou the Sun!
Forgive w" if as days decline -

By a mmble love -
If I weld the Rivet faster -
Final fast -above -
In keen and
quivering ratio
To the ecstasy.
For each beloved hour
Sharp pIttances of years -
Bitter contested farthings-
Who fall-and
none observe -
Whose dyIng eyes,
no Country
Regards with patriot love -
We trust,
in plumed procession
For such,
the Angels go -

Beneath the village door,
UntIl the Bees,
from Clover rows
Their Hock,
Sherry,

Why,
I will lend until just then,

I shall not fear mistake -
I shall not cheated wake -

This - the sIgnal woe'

Did the Harebell loose her girdle
To the lover Bee
Would the Bee the Harebell hallow
Much as formerly'
From inns of Molten Blue -
When "Landlords" turn the drunken Bee
Out of the Foxglove's door-
When ButterflIes - renounce theIr "drams" -
I shall but drink the morel
We chant - for cheer -when
the Wines - fail-
Do we "get drunk"?
Ask the jolly Clovers!
Do we "beat" our "WIfe"?

All life -to know each other -
Whom we can never learn -
And helps us to forget -
The absent - mystIc - creature -
That but for love of us -
Had gone to sleep - that

WIthout the weariness-

Morning means just Risk - to the Lover -
Just revelation -to the Beloved -

Brides - an Apocalypse-
But the Fir is Where - Declare -
Were you ever there?
If He brings Odors of Clovers -
And that
IS His business - not Ours -
Then He has been with the Mowers -
Like the June Bee - before the School Boy,
Invites the Race -
Stoops -to an easy Clover -

Then - to the Royal Clouds
Look!
Her little Book-
The leaf - at love - turned back-
Her very Hat-
And this worn shoe just fits the track­
Except to stray abroad
On MIscellaneous Enterpnse

A single Clover Plank
Was all that
saved a Bee
A Bee I personally knew
And almost count it an Affront
The presence to concede
Of one however lovely,
not
The one that
we have loved-
So we evade the charge of Years
On one attempting shy
Unobserved - a RIbbon shpt,
Snatch it for yourself.
Summer laid her supple Glove
In its sylvan Drawer-
Wheresoe'er,

Built of but Just a syllable
The hugest hearts that

Unquestionably loved-
But Summer does not care-
She goes her spacious way

Allures his jaded eye

From all the Jails the Boys and

Ecstatically leap-
Beloved only Afternoon

They stann the Earth and

Coffee should be black as hell,
strong as death,
and
sweet as love.
Now let’s apply this to wealth:
Instead of viewing wealth as a static,
zero-sum quantity,
One
can realize that
wealth is actually produced,
that
wealth,
like love,
is an infinite value to
be earned [by virtue of productiveness].
One can take endless amounts of selfish happiness
Quote:
is an infinite value to be earned
Do we need to earn love?

you don’t believe that
your partner has your best interests at heart,
a lack of trust will quickly creep into the relationship.
In this case,
you may have a feeling
that
someone you love or trust does not hold the same feelings towards you and
may someday abandon you or betray you.

Thanks very much for the great article and

Would love to see what else your hiding

list of yours.
For me the importance of the list is not so much about ticking off the items.
pull out our life lists to see what we had accomplished,
what we wanted to add,
and
adjust what we wasn’t as important
anymore.
Many people tell us that
we’re lucky that
we ended up together since we both share the love of travel and
other values.
We’re fortunate to have met by chance,

doing and

After making the tour of the

Little Dorrit's lover with a hurried heart went up-stairs,

Young John.
Nay,

condescension,

It was an affecting illustration of the fallacy of human projects,
to behold her lover,
with the great hat pulled over his eyes,

the plum-coloured coat
buttoned to conceal the silken waistcoat of golden sprigs,
were a spectacle to wonder at.
They walked up and
down the yard on the evening of Little Dorrit's
Sunday interview with her lover on the Iron Bridge.

benefits of locking lips with a loved one.
After doing some digging in my university’s online archives,
the latest empirical study I could find was one
published back in 2003 by Brigham Young University researchers Andrew Gulledge and
colleagues.
However,
the
results give us at least some ideas about how to categorize,
and
eventually understand,
what it means
when
your loved one exclaims “I want to hold your hand,” as the song says.
The starting point in all of this is deciding what we mean by physical affection.
According to the Brigham
com/basics/teamwork),
it’s best defined as “any touch intended
to arouse feelings of love in the giver and/or recipient”
(p.
234).
For the purposes of developing a
classification scheme of physical affection in general,
the researchers decided to eliminate sexual intimacy
which isn't specifically aimed at arousing "feelings of love.
See how you would score on the questionnaires used in this study.
For each of the following,

On the matter of backrubs,
the findings also show the importance of considering gender differences.
As the
authors pointed out,
men see giving massages as a greater indication of love than do women.
They may be
more likely to express their feelings in this way which,
for the woman,
may be a physically enjoyable
experience but not as direct a way of saying “I love you” as is just plain cuddling or holding.

Speaking a lie is betraying trust and
therefore a lie always hurts.
Big or small,
you should never lie to someone you love.
The bigger the lie,
the more it will hurt your relationship.
Honesty is as important to your relationship as love.
Lying contradicts everything that
love stands for.
Love is meant to be a mechanism of openness and

When you lie to your partner,
she/he will lose trust in you.
If you lose trust in your relationship,
you lose the relationship,

Lying to someone that
you love is unfair because it is manipulative,
selfish and
self-serving.
Telling a lie to a person you love is akin to telling them you don’t love them.
Love depends on total trust.
Without it,
there isn’t love because deceit is not a loving act.
When a lover lies to his partner,
not only does it break trust,
but it also breaks
hearts.
Liars lie because they believe it will preserve their relationship.
It assumes the recipient of deceit cannot handle the truth,
hence the truth is distorted or withheld
from them.
Lies not only destroy love between of a couple,
but also the person who was deceived.

../1-txt/emo/The Five Love Languages - Wikipedia.txt
------
Commitment to Your Mate is a 1995 book by Gary Chapman.
[1] It
outlines five ways to express and
experience love that
Chapman calls "love
languages":
gift giving,
quality time,
words of affirmation,
acts of service
(devotion),
and
physical touch.
[2] Examples are given from his counseling
practice,
as well as questions to help determine one's own love languages.
Chapman's book claims that
the list of five love languages is
exhaustive.
[3][4] According to this theory,
each person has one primary and
one secondary love language.
Chapman suggests that
to discover another person's love language,
one
must observe the way they express love to others,
analyze what they
complain about most often and
what they request from their significant
other most often.
He theorizes that
people tend to naturally give love in the
way that
they prefer to receive love,
better communication between
couples can be accomplished when
one can demonstrate caring to the
other person in the love language the recipient understands.
An example
would be if a husband's love language is acts of service,
he may be
confused when
he does the laundry for his wife and
she doesn't perceive
that
as an act of love,
viewing it as simply performing household duties,
because the love language she comprehends is words of affirmation

Those infamous five love languages sound cheesy,
but
decoding them can really help your relationship
Let's face it,
if you aren't really familiar with what Dr.
Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages is all about,
it sounds
pretty over-the-top lovey dovey — so much so,
many people think it probably can't really be applied to their real-life
relationships.
But the fact of the matter is,
Dr.
http://www.
sheknows.
com/love-and-sex/articles/1059295/What-are-the-5-Love-Languages 1/5
10/31/2017 What Are the Five Love Languages?
According to Dr.
Chapman,
there are ﬁve universal ways that
all
people express and
interpret love.
Through his more than 30 years of couples counseling,
Chapman has noticed
speciﬁc patterns in the way partners communicate — and
it turns out that
most of the population express and
interpret love in the same ﬁve ways,
according to his observations.
More:
How The Bachelor's Ben uses 'love languages' to show his feelings
These expressions and
interpretations are his famous ﬁve love languages.
Chapman ﬁrmly believes that
each person has one primary and
one secondary love language
(you can take a quiz
on his website to determine what your personal love languages are),
and
he theorizes people tend to give love in the
com/love-and-sex/articles/1059295/What-are-the-5-Love-Languages 2/5
way they prefer to receive love.
Since we don't all have the same preferences as our partners when
it comes to giving
receiving love,
this is how relationships can start to get sticky.
But by understanding our partners' inherent love
language,
we can start to tear down walls in our romantic lives.
Let's ﬁnally learn what the love languages are.
1.
Words of affirmation
this language uses words to afﬁrm other people.
For those who prefer the words of
afﬁrmation language,
hearing "I love you" and
other compliments are what they value the most.
Words hold real value
within this language.
Furthermore,
negative or insulting comments cut deep — and
won't be easily forgiven.
More: At my loneliest I remember that
my true love hasn't found me either
2.
Quality time
This language is all about giving the other person your undivided attention.
Unlike the words of afﬁrmation language,
talk is cheap and
being a loved one's main focus leaves quality timers feeling satisﬁed and
comforted.
Distractions,
postponed dates,
or the failure to listen can be especially hurtful to these individuals.
Receiving gifts
Chapman says for some people,
what makes them feel most loved is to receive a tangible gift.
This doesn't
necessarily mean the person is materialistic,
but a meaningful or thoughtful present it was makes them feel
appreciated.
A person who speaks the language of physical touch isn't necessarily an over-the-top PDAer,
but getting
a little touchy-feely does make them feel safe and
loved.
Any instance of physical abuse is a total deal breaker.

More: 9 red ﬂags your partner is totally guilty of gaslighting you
One more thing...
Just because you or your partner favor a particular love language,
doesn't mean you should stop expressing the other
love languages.
According to Chapman,
even though we tend to favor one language more than the others we still
enjoy traits of the others as well.

Plot summary
The book is the story of Sethe and
her daughter Denver after their escape from slavery.
He seems successful at first;
he even brings housebound Denver out of the house for the
first time in years.
But on the way back,
they encounter a young woman sitting in front of the house,
calling herself Beloved.
Paul D is suspicious and
warns Sethe,
but she is charmed by the young woman and
ignores him.
Gradually,
Paul D is forced
out of Sethe's home by a supernatural presence.
When made to sleep outside in a shed,
Paul D is cornered by Beloved.
While they have sex,
his mind is filled with horrific
memories from his past.
Overwhelmed with guilt,
Paul D tries to tell Sethe about it but cannot,
and
instead says he wants
her pregnant.
Sethe is elated,
Paul D resists Beloved and
her influence over him.
But when
he tells friends at work
about his plans to start a new family,
they react fearfully.
Without him,
sense of reality and
time moving
forward disappears.
Sethe comes to believe that
Beloved is the two-year-old daughter she murdered,
whose tombstone reads only "Beloved".
Sethe begins to spend carelessly and
spoil Beloved out of guilt.
Beloved becomes angry and
more demanding,
throwing
tantrums when
she doesn't get her way.
Beloved's presence consumes Sethe's life to the point where she becomes depleted
sacrifices her own need for eating,
while Beloved grows bigger and
bigger.
In the novel's climax,
youngest daughter Denver reaches out and
searches for help from the black community,
some of
the village women arrive at the house to exorcise Beloved.
At the same time,
a white man comes into view,
the same man
that
helped Halle's mother,
Baby Suggs,
by offering her the house as a place to stay after Halle bought her from their owner.
situation,
Sethe attacks the white man with an ice pick and
is brought down by the village women.
While Sethe is confused
has a "re-memory" of her master coming again,
Beloved disappears.
The novel resolves with Denver becoming a
working member of the community and
Paul D returning to Sethe and
pledging his love.
Major themes
Mother-daughter relationships
2/7
The maternal bonds between Sethe and
her children inhibit her own individuation and
prevent the development of her self.
Sethe develops a dangerous maternal passion that
results in the murder of one daughter,
her own “best self,” and
the
with this community in order to enter into womanhood.
Denver finally succeeds at the end of the novel in establishing her
own self and
embarking on her individuation with the help of Beloved.
Contrary to Denver,
Sethe only becomes
individuated after Beloved’s exorcism,
at which point Sethe can fully accept the first relationship that
is completely “for
her,” her relationship with Paul D.
This relationship relieves Sethe from the ensuing destruction of herself that
resulted
from the maternal bonds controlling her life.
[6] Beloved and
Sethe are both very much emotionally impaired as a result of
Sethe’s previous enslavement.
Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child,
which has devastating
Denver all experience this loss of self,
which could only be remedied by the acceptance of the past and
the memory of their
original identities.
Beloved serves to remind these characters of their repressed memories,
eventually causing the
reintegration of their selves.
[7]
The power lies in the audience,
or more precisely,
in the word – once the word changes,
so does
the identity.
All of the characters in Beloved face the challenge of an unmade self,
composed of their "rememories" and
defined by perceptions and
language.
The barrier that
keeps them from remaking of the self is the desire for an
Her
character is resilient,
yet defined by her traumatic past.
3/7
The opaque understanding of Beloved is central to the novel.
She is a young woman who mysteriously appears from a body
of water near Sethe's house and
is discovered soaking wet on the doorstep by Sethe,
Paul D,
Denver,
on their return
ends when
she arrives,
in many ways she behaves like a child.
The murdered baby was unnamed,
her name is derived
from the engraving on Sethe's murdered baby's tombstone,
which simply read "Beloved" because Sethe could not afford to
engrave the word "Dearly" or anything else.
Beloved becomes a catalyst to bring repressed trauma of the family to the
surface,
but also creates madness in the house and
slowly depletes Sethe.

Adaptations
In 1998,
the novel was made into a film directed by Jonathan Demme and
produced by and
starring Oprah Winfrey.
In January 2016,
Beloved was broadcast in 10 episodes by BBC Radio 4 as part of its 15 Minute Drama programme.

Critical reception
The publication of Beloved in 1987 resulted in the greatest acclaim yet for Morrison.
Although nominated for the National
Book Award,
it did not win,
forty-eight African-American writers and
critics signed a letter of protest,
which was
published in The New York Times.
Yet Beloved did receive the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1988,
as well as the Robert F.
Kennedy Memorial Book Award,
the Melcher Book Award,
the Lyndhurst Foundation Award,
the Elmer Holmes Bobst
Award.
[16] Despite its popularity and
status as one of Morrison’s most accomplished novels,
Beloved has never been
universally hailed as a success.
Some reviewers have excoriated the novel for what they consider its excessive sentimentality
sensationalistic depiction of the horrors of slavery,
including its characterization of the slave trade as a Holocaust-like
genocide.
Others,
while concurring that
Beloved is at times overwritten,
have lauded the novel as a profound and
extraordinary act of imagination.
Noting the work’s mythic dimensions and
political focus,
these commentators have
historical record and
give voice to the collective memory of African Americans.
Indeed,
critics and
Morrison herself have
indicated that
the controversial epitaph to Beloved,
"sixty million and
more",
is drawn from a number of studies on the
African slave trade which estimate that
approximately half of each ship’s "cargo" perished in transit to America.
Scholars
have additionally debated the nature of the character Beloved,
arguing whether she is actually a ghost or a real person.
Numerous reviews,
assuming Beloved to be a supernatural incarnation of Sethe’s daughter,
have subsequently faulted
Beloved as an unconvincing and
confusing ghost story.
Elizabeth B.
House,
however,
has argued that
Beloved is not a ghost,
the novel is actually a story of two probable instances of mistaken identity.
Beloved is haunted by the loss of her African
parents and
thus comes to believe that
Sethe is her mother.
Sethe longs for her dead daughter and
is rather easily convinced
Beloved is the child she has lost.
Such an interpretation,
House contends,
clears up many puzzling aspects of the novel
emphasizes Morrison’s concern with familial ties.
5/7
Since the late 1970s,
there has indeed been a strong focus on Morrison’s representation of African-American experience and
history.
suggests that
Morrison’s stories unite communities.
[18] Many critics explore memory,
or what
Beloved’s Sethe calls "rememory",
in this light.
Susan Bowers places Morrison in a "long tradition of African American
apocalyptic writing" that
looks back in time,
"unveiling" the horrors of the past in order to "transform" them.
simply curative”:
in raising the ghosts of the past in order to banish or memorialize them,
the texts potentially “provoke
readers to the vicarious experience of trauma and
act as a means of transmission".
[21] Ann Snitow’s reaction to Beloved
neatly illustrates how Morrison criticism began to evolve and
move toward new modes of interpretation.
In her 1987 review
of Beloved,
Snitow argues that
the ghost at the center of the narrative,
is "too light" and
"hollow",
rendering the
entire novel "airless".
Snitow changed her position after reading criticism that
interpreted Beloved in a different way,
seeing
something more complicated and
burdened than a literal ghost,
something requiring different forms of creative expression

surrendering to the habit,
Beloved began inching down Bluestone Road further and
further each day to meet Sethe and
walk her back to 124.
It
was as though every afternoon she doubted anew the older woman's return.
Sethe was flattered by Beloved's open,
quiet devotion.
The same adoration from her daughter
(had it been forthcoming)
would have annoyed her;
made her chill at the thought of having raised a ridiculously dependent child.
Then she sat herself down to rest.
The
heat of the stove made her drowsy and
she was sliding into sleep when
she felt Beloved touch her.
A touch no heavier
than a feather but loaded,
nevertheless,
with desire.
Sethe stirred and
looked around.
First at Beloved's soft new hand
on her shoulder,
then into her eyes.
The longing she saw there was bottomless.
Some plea barely in control.
Sethe
patted Beloved's fingers and
glanced at Denver,
whose eyes were fixed on her pea-sorting task.
"Where your diamonds?
" Beloved searched Sethe's face.
"Diamonds?
What would I be doing with diamonds?
I had some crystal once.
A present from a lady I worked for.
"Tell me," said Beloved,
smiling a wide happy smile.
"Tell me your diamonds.
It became a way to feed her.
Just as Denver discovered and
relied on the delightful effect sweet things had on Beloved,
Sethe learned the profound satisfaction Beloved got from storytelling.
It amazed Sethe
(as much as it pleased Beloved)
because every mention of her past life hurt.
Everything in it was painful or lost.
always there-like a tender place in the corner of her mouth that
the bit left.
But,
as she began telling about the earrings,
she found herself wanting to,
liking it.
Perhaps it was Beloved's distance
from the events itself,
or her thirst for hearing it--in any case it was an unexpected pleasure.
Above the patter of the pea sorting and
the sharp odor of cooking rutabaga,
Sethe explained the crystal that
once hung
through the wind back into the house with rainsoaked sheets and
petticoats.
Panting,
laughing,
they draped the laundry over the chairs and
table.
Beloved filled herself with water from the bucket and
watched while Sethe rubbed Denver's hair with a piece of
toweling.
"Maybe we should unbraid it?
"Ouch.
"Your woman she never fix up your hair?
" Beloved asked.
Sethe and
Denver looked up at her.
After four weeks they still had not got used to the gravelly voice and
the song that
The rest was a gleaming,
powerful world made more so by Denver's absence from it.
Not
being in it,
she hated it and
wanted Beloved to hate it too,
although there was no chance of that
at all.
Beloved took every opportunity to ask some funny question and
get Sethe going.
Denver noticed how greedy she was to
hear Sethe talk.
Now she noticed something more.
The questions Beloved asked:
And most perplexing:
Tell me your earrings.
By the time the white petals died

Paul D took to having Sethe on waking,
so that
later,
he went down the white stairs where she made
bread under Beloved's gaze,
his head was clear.
In the evening when
he came home and
the three of them were all there fixing the supper table,
her shine was so
pronounced he wondered why Denver and
Sethe did not see it.
Or maybe they did.
Certainly women could tell,
as men could,
one of their number was aroused.
Paul D looked carefully at Beloved
to see if she was aware of it but she paid him no attention at all--frequently not even answering a direct question put
to her.

dishing up bread pudding,
murmuring her hopes for it,
apologizing in advance the way veteran cooks always do,
something in Beloved's face,
some petlike adoration that
took hold of her as she looked at Sethe,
made Paul D speak.
"Ain't you got no brothers or sisters?
Beloved diddled her spoon but did not look at him.
"I don't have nobody.
"What was you looking for when
you came here?
" she shouted and
gave him a look so malevolent Denver
touched her arm.
"I'll teach you," said Denver,
"how to tie your shoes," and
got a smile from Beloved as a reward.
Paul D had the feeling a large,
silver fish had slipped from his hands the minute he grabbed hold of its tail.

wondering if she was going to be sick again,

Denver sat on the bed smiling and
providing the music.
She had never seen Beloved this happy.
She had seen her pouty lips open wide with the pleasure of sugar or some piece
of news Denver gave her.
She had felt warm satisfaction radiating from Beloved's skin when
she listened to her mother
talk about the old days.
But gaiety she had never seen.
Not ten minutes had passed since Beloved had fallen backward to the floor,
pop-eyed,
thrashing and
holding her throat.
Now,
after a few seconds lying in Denver's bed,
she was up and
dancing.
"Nowhere.
Look at me do this.
" Beloved put her fists on her hips and
commenced to skip on bare feet.
Denver laughed.
"Now you.
Come on," said Beloved.
"You may as well just come on.
" Her black skirt swayed from side to side.
Denver grew ice-cold as she rose from the bed.
She knew she was twice Beloved's size but she floated up,

Beloved closed her eyes.

Denver scooted a little closer.
"What's it like over there,
where you were before?
Can you tell me?
"Dark," said Beloved.
"I'm small in that
place.
I'm like this here.
Denver covered her lips with her fingers.
"Were you cold?
Beloved curled tighter and
shook her head.

no room to move in.
When I got out.
"What did you come back for?
Beloved smiled.
"To see her face.
"Ma'am's?
"Yes,
Denver felt a little hurt,
slighted that
she was not the main reason for Beloved's return.
"Don't you remember we played
together by the stream?
"I was on the bridge," said Beloved.
"You see me on the bridge?
by the stream.
"What stopped you?
"She left me behind.
By myself," said Beloved.
She lifted her eyes to meet Denver's and
frowned,
perhaps.
Perhaps not.
45
Suddenly Denver,
who was sitting cross-legged,
lurched forward and
grabbed Beloved's wrist.
"Don't tell her.
Don't let
"Don't tell me what to do.
Don't you never never tell me what to do.
"But I'm on your side,
"She is the one.
She is the one I need.
Let's.
"I don't want to.
" Beloved got up and
lay down on the bed.
Their quietness boomed about on the walls like birds in
panic.
Finally Denver's breath steadied against the threat of an unbearable loss.
"Tell me," Beloved said.
"Tell me how Sethe made you in the boat.
"She never told me all of it," said Denver.
Denver climbed up on the bed and
folded her arms under her apron.
She had not been in the tree room once since
Beloved sat on their stump after the carnival,
had not remembered that
she had not gone there until this very
desperate moment.
Nothing was out there that
this sister-girl did not provide in abundance:
a racing heart,
dreaminess,
society,
danger,
beauty.
She swallowed twice to prepare for the telling,
to construct out of the strings she had heard all
her life a net to hold Beloved.
"She had good hands,
The whitegirl,
had thin little arms but good hands.
here girl Amy helped.
Denver stopped and
sighed.
This was the part of the story she loved.
She was coming to it now,
she loved it because
it was all about herself;
but she hated it too because it made her feel like a bill was owing somewhere and
she,
Denver,
had to pay it.
But who she owed or what to pay it with eluded her.
watching Beloved's alert and
hungry face,
how she took in every word,
asking questions about the color of things and
their size,
her downright craving to know,
Denver began to see what she was saying and
not just to hear it:
there is this nineteen-year-old slave girl--a year older
She is not so afraid at night because she is the color of it,
but in the
day every sound is a shot or a tracker's quiet step.
Denver was seeing it now and
feeling it--through Beloved.
Feeling how it must have felt to her mother.
Seeing how it
must have looked.
And the more fine points she made,
the more detail she provided,
the more Beloved liked it.
So she anticipated the
questions by giving blood to the scraps her mother and
grandmother had told herwand
a heartbeat.
The monologue
became,
iri fact,
a duet as they lay down together,
Denver nursing Beloved's interest like a lover whose pleasure was to
overfeed the loved.
The dark quilt with two orange patches was there with them because Beloved wanted it near her
she slept.
It was smelling like grass and
feeling like hands
--the unrested hands of busy women:
dry,
warm,
prickly.
Denver spoke,
Beloved listened,
the two did the best they could to create what really happened,
how it really was,
something only Sethe knew because she alone had the mind for it and
the time afterward to shape it:
the quality of
Amy's voice,
her breath like burning wood.
Sethe decided to go to the Clearing,
back where Baby Suggs had danced in sunlight.
Before 124 and
everybody in it had closed down,
veiled over and
shut away;
before it had become the plaything of
spirits and
the home of the chafed,
124 had been a cheerful,
buzzing house where Baby Suggs,
holy,
loved,
cautioned,
fed,
chastised and
soothed.
Where not one but two pots simmered on the stove;
where the lamp burned all night long.
Love it.
Love it hard.
Yonder they do not love your flesh.
They despise it.
They don't love your eyes;
they'd just as soon pick em out.
No more
do they love the skin on your back.
Yonder they flay it.
And O my people they do not love your hands.
Those they only
use,
tie,
bind,
chop off and
leave empty.
Raise them up and
kiss them.
Touch others with
them,
pat them together,
stroke them on your face 'cause they don't love that
either.
You got to love it,
you!
And no,
they ain't in love with your mouth.
Yonder,
out there,
they will see it broken and
break it again.
What you say out of it
What you put into it to nourish your body they will snatch
away and
give you leavins instead.
they don't love your mouth.
This is flesh I'm talking about here.
Flesh that
needs to be loved.
Feet that
need to rest and
to dance;
backs that
need support;
shoulders that
need arms,
strong arms I'm telling you.
O my people,
out yonder,
hear me,
they do not love your neck unnoosed and
straight.
So love your neck;
put a hand
on
grace it,
stroke it and
hold it up.
And all your inside parts that
they'd just as soon slop for hogs,
you got to love them.
The dark,
dark liver--love it,
the beat and
beating heart,
love that
More than eyes or feet.
More than lungs that
have yet to draw free air.
More than your life holding womb and
your life-giving private parts,
hear
me now,
love your heart.
For this is the prize.
" Saying no more,
she stood up then and
danced with her twisted hip the
rest of what her heart had to say while the others opened their mouths and
gave her the music.
Long notes held until the four-part harmony was perfect enough for their deeply loved flesh.
Sethe wanted to be there now.
At the least to listen to the spaces that
the long-ago singing had left behind.
53
There was no grace-imaginary or real--and
no sunlit dance in a Clearing could change that.
Her faith,
her love,
imagination and
her great big old heart began to collapse twenty-eight days after her daughter-in-law arrived.
Yet it was to the Clearing that
Sethe determined to go--to pay tribute to Halle.
Before the light changed,
while it was still
the green blessed place she remembered:
misty with plant steam and
the decay of berries.
She put on a shawl and
told Denver and
Beloved to do likewise.
All three set out late one Sunday morning,
Sethe leading,
the girls trotting behind,
not a soul in sight.
When they reached the woods it took her no time to find the path through it because big-city revivals were held there
"Hard to say," she said.
"If
anybody was to ask me I'd say,
'Don't love nothing.
' " Then,
as if to take the edge off her pronouncement,
she smiled at
because they said,
"Pappie come?
She did not cry.
She said "soon" and
smiled so they would think the brightness in her eyes was love alone.
It was some
time before she let Baby Suggs shoo the boys away so Sethe could put on the gray cotton dress her mother-in-law had
Freeing yourself was one thing;
claiming ownership of that
freed self was another.
Now she sat on Baby Suggs' rock,
Beloved watching her from the trees.
There will never be a day,
thought,
Halle will knock on the door.
the touch,
childlike almost,
more finger kiss than kneading.
Still she was grateful for the effort;
Baby Suggs' long distance
love was equal to any skin-close love she had known.
The desire,
let alone the gesture,
to meet her needs was good
enough to lift her spirits to the place where she could take the next step:
ask for some clarifying word;
some advice
Tumbling forward from her seat on the rock,
she clawed at the
hands that
were not there.
Her feet were thrashing by the time Denver got to her and
then Beloved.
"Ma'am!
turned her mother over on her back.
The fingers left off and
Sethe had to swallow huge draughts of air before she recognized her daughter's face next to her
own and
Beloved's hovering above.
"You all right?
"Somebody choked me," said Sethe.
"Help me up from here.
"Look.
" Beloved was pointing at Sethe's neck.
What you see?
"Bruises," said Denver.
"On my neck?
"Here," said Beloved.
"Here and
here,
" She reached out her hand
touched the splotches,
gathering color darker
than Sethe's dark throat,
her fingers were mighty cool.
"That don't help nothing," Denver said,
but Beloved was leaning in,
her two hands stroking the damp skin that
felt like
chamois and
looked like taffeta.
Sethe moaned.
anything.
Now a hint of what had happened to Halie and
she cut out like a rabbit looking for its mother.
Beloved's fingers were heavenly.
Under them and
breathing evenly again,
the anguish rolled down.
The peace Sethe had
come there to find crept into her.
We must look a sight,
she thought,
closed her eyes to see it:
the three women in the middle of the Clearing,
at the
base of the rock where Baby Suggs,
had loved.
One seated,
yielding up her throat to the kind hands of one of the
two kneeling before her.
Denver watched the faces of the other two.
Beloved watched the work her thumbs were doing and
must have loved
58
what she saw because she leaned over and
kissed the tenderness under Sethe's chin.
They stayed that
way for a while because neither Denver nor Sethe knew how not to:
how to stop and
not love the look
or feel of the lips that
kept on kissing.
Then Sethe,
grabbing Beloved's hair
blinking rapidly,
separated herself.
She later believed that
it was because the girl's breath was exactly like new milk
as they had when
they had come:
Sethe in the lead,
the girls a ways back.
All silent as before,
but with a difference.
Sethe was bothered,
not because of the kiss,
but because,
just before it,
she was feeling so fine letting Beloved
massage away the pain,
the fingers she was loving and
the ones that
had soothed her before they strangled her had
reminded her of something that
now slipped her mind.
collected itself in the Clearing.
Reasonable,
Why she had taken Denver and
Beloved with her did not puzzle her now--at the time it seemed impulse,
with a vague
wish for protection.
And the girls had saved her,
Beloved so agitated she behaved like a two-year-old.
Like a faint smell of burning that

ways you wouldn't believe either.
The consequence was a timid but hard-headed daughter Sethe would die to protect.
The other,
she knew less,
nothing,
about---except that
there was nothing she wouldn't do for Sethe and
she liked each other's company.
Now she thought she knew why.
Just like the day she arrived at 124--sure enough,
she had milk enough
for all.
Beloved came through the door and
they ought to have heard her tread,
but they did not.
Breathing and
murmuring,
Beloved heard them as soon as the door banged shut behind her.
She jumped at the slam and
swiveled her head toward the whispers coming from behind the white stairs.
She took a

Him who kept her hidden at night behind doors.
And him who had hold of her now whispering behind the stairs after Beloved had rescued her neck and
was ready now
to put her hand
in that
woman's own.
Beloved turned around and
left.
Denver had not arrived,
or else she was waiting somewhere outside.
Beloved went to

She followed the blood spot shifting in the leaves until she

"I did not do it.
"You told me you loved her.
"I fixed it,
did not I?
Didn't I fix her neck?
The circle of iron choked it.
"I saw you.
" Denver grabbed Beloved's arm.
"Look out,
girl," said Beloved and,
snatching her arm away,
ran ahead as fast as she could along the stream that
sang on
the other side of the woods.
Left alone,
Denver wondered if,
indeed,
she had been wrong.
She and
Beloved were standing in the trees whispering,
while Sethe sat on the rock.
Denver knew that
the Clearing used to be where Baby Suggs preached,
but that
was when
That was when
she walked off to follow the children to Lady Jones' house-school.
it held for her all the anger,
love and
fear she did not know what to do with.
she did muster the courage to
ask Nelson Lord's question,
she could not hear Sethe's answer,
nor Baby Suggs' words,
nor anything at all thereafter.
she saw the black dress with two unlaced shoes beneath it she trembled with secret thanks.
Whatever her power and
however she used it,
Beloved was hers.
Denver was alarmed by the harm she thought Beloved
planned for Sethe,
but felt helpless to thwart it,
so unrestricted was her need to love another.
The display she witnessed
at the Clearing shamed her because the choice between Sethe and
Beloved was without conflict.
Walking toward the stream,
beyond her green bush house,
she let herself wonder what if Beloved really decided to
choke her mother.
Would she let it happen?
Until Paul D came.
But the damage he
did came undone with the miraculous resurrection of Beloved.
Just ahead,
at the edge of the stream,
Denver could see her silhouette,
standing barefoot in the water,
liking her black
skirts up above her calves,
the beautiful head lowered in rapt attention.
Blinking fresh tears Denver approached her--eager for a word,
a sign of forgiveness.
Denver took off her shoes and
stepped into the water with her.
It took a moment for her to drag her eyes from the spectacle of Beloved's head to see what she was staring at.
A turtle inched along the edge,
turned and
climbed to dry ground.
Not far behind it was another one,
headed in the same direction.
face.
The gravity of their shields,
clashing,
countered and
mocked the floating heads touching.
Beloved dropped the folds of her skirt.
It spread around her.
The hem darkened in the water.
They killed a boss so often and
so completely they had to bring him back to life to pulp him one more time.
Tasting hot mealcake among pine trees,
they beat it away.
Singing love songs to Mr.
Death,
they smashed his head.
The next evening he did it again and
then again.
He was accustomed to sex with Sethe just about every day,
to
avoid the confusion Beloved's shining caused him he still made it his business to take her back upstairs in the morning,
or lie down with her after supper.
But he found a way and
a reason to spend the longest part of the night in the rocker.
But always he associated the house-fit with the woman in it.
This nervousness
had nothing to do with the woman,
whom he loved a little bit more every day:
her hands among vegetables,
her mouth
she licked a thread end before guiding it through a needle or bit it in two when
the seam was done,
the blood in
her eye when
she defended her girls
Beloved was hers now)
or any coloredwoman from a slur.
Also in this house-
fit there was no anger,
no suffocation,
no yearning to be elsewhere.
"When good people take you in and
treat you good,
you ought to try to be good back.
You don't...
Sethe loves you.
Much as her own daughter.
You know that.
Beloved dropped her skirts as he spoke and
looked at him with empty eyes.
She took a step he could not hear and
stood
close behind him.
"She don't love me like I love her.
I don't love nobody but her.
"Then what you come in here for?
"I want you to touch me on the inside part.
"Please call it.
I'll go if you call it.
" He said it,
but she did not go.
She moved closer with a footfall he did not hear and
he did not hear the whisper
But to be looked
at in turn was beyond appetite;
it was breaking through her own skin to a place where hunger had not been discovered.
It did not have to happen often,
because Beloved seldom looked right at her,
or when
she did,
Denver could tell that
her own face was just the place those eyes stopped while the mind behind it walked on.
But sometimes--at moments
Denver could neither anticipate nor create--Beloved rested cheek on knuckles and
looked at Denver with attention.
It was lovely.
Not to be stared at,
not seen,
but being pulled into view by the interested,
uncritical eyes of the other.
Having her hair examined as a part of her self,
not as material or a style.
Needing nothing.
Being what there was.
At such times it seemed to be Beloved who needed somethingm wanted something.
Deep down in her wide black eyes,
back behind the expressionlessness,
was a palm held out for a penny which Denver would gladly give her,
if only she

would say she remembered a woman who was hers,
she remembered
being snatched away from her.
Other than that,
the clearest memory she had,
the one she repeated,
was the bridge--
Sethe found that

more evidence to support her conclusions,
which she confided to Denver.
"Where'd you get the dress,

Beloved said she took them.
"Who from?

a faster scratching of her hand.
She did not know;
she saw them and
just took them.
"Uh huh," said Sethe,
told Denver that
she believed Beloved had been locked up by some whiteman for his own
purposes,
never let out the door.
That she must have escaped to a bridge or someplace and
rinsed the rest out of
For more than a year,
they kept her locked in a room for themselves.
"You couldn't think up," Ella had said,
"what them two done to me.
Sethe thought it explained Beloved's behavior around Paul D,
whom she hated so.
Denver neither believed nor commented on Sethe's speculations,
she lowered her eyes and
never said a word about
the cold house.
She was certain that
Beloved was the white dress that
had knelt with her mother in the keeping room,
the true-to-life
presence of the baby that
had kept her company most of her life.
And to be looked at by her,
however briefly,
kept her
nothing to do with the past.
The present alone interested Denver,
but she was careful to appear uninquisitive about
the things she was dying to ask Beloved,
for if she pressed too hard,
she might lose the penny that
the held-out palm
wanted,
lose,
therefore,
the place beyond appetite.
It was better to feast,
to have permission to be the looker,
because the old hunger--the before-Beloved hunger that
drove her into boxwood and
cologne for just a taste of a life,
feel it bumpy and
not flat--was out of the question.
Looking kept it at bay.
So she did not ask Beloved how she knew about the earrings,
the night walks to the cold house or the tip of the thing
she saw when
Beloved lay down or came undone in her sleep.
The look,
it came,
came when
Denver had been

She described them to Beloved
slowly,
to keep her attention,
dwelling on their habits,
the games they taught her and
not the fright that
drove them
increasingly out of the house---anywhere--and
finally far away.
Denver has finished singing the counting song
Lady Jones taught her students.

entertain the dancer.

swallows them like minnows.
The door bangs shut.
Denver can't tell where Beloved is standing.
"Where are you?

"Here," says Beloved.
"Where?
"Come find me," says Beloved.
Denver stretches out her right arm and
takes a step or two.
She trips and
falls down onto the pallet.
She laughs again.

The room is just as it was when

There is no point in looking further,
for everything in the place can be seen at first sight.
No footfall announces her,
but there she is,
standing where before there was nobody when
Denver looked.
And smiling.
Denver grabs the hem of Beloved's skirt.
"I thought you left me.
I thought you went back.
Beloved smiles,
"I don't want that
This the place I am.
She sits down on the pallet and,
lies back looking at the cracklights above.
Surreptitiously,
Denver pinches a piece of Beloved's skirt between her fingers and
holds on.
A good thing she does
because suddenly Beloved sits up.
" asks Denver.
I don't see nothing.
" Denver follows the pointing finger.
Beloved drops her hand.
"I'm like this.
Denver watches as Beloved bends over,
curls up and
rocks.
Her eyes go to no place;
her moaning is so small Denver can
hardly hear it.
Beloved focuses her eyes.
"Over there.
Her face.
Denver looks where Beloved's eyes go;
there is nothing but darkness there.
"Whose face?
Who is it?
Because he was a man and
a man could do what he would:
be

fight raccoon with his hands and
win;
watch another man,

roast without a tear just so the roasters would know what a man was like.
And it was he,
man,
who had walked from Georgia to Delaware,
who could not go or stay put where he wanted to in 124--shame.

Beloved did not look at Paul D;
her scrutiny was for Sethe.
She had no coat,
no wrap,
nothing on her head,
but she held
in her hand
a long shawl.
"You the one out here with nothing on.
" And stepping away and
in front of Paul D,
Sethe took
the shawl and
wrapped it around Beloved's head and
shoulders.
Saying,
"You got to learn more sense than that," she
enclosed her in her left arm.
Snowflakes stuck now.
Paul D felt icy cold in the place Sethe had been before Beloved came.
Trailing a yard or so behind
the women,
he fought the anger that
shot through his stomach all the way home.

who thought she knew all about silence,
was surprised to learn hunger could do that:
quiet
you down and
wear you out.
Neither Sethe nor Beloved knew or cared about it one way or another.
They were too busy
rationing their strength to fight each other.
The flesh between her mother's forefinger and
thumb was thin as china silk and
there wasn't
a piece of clothing in the house that
did not sag on her.
Beloved held her head up with the palms of her hands,
slept
wherever she happened to be,
whined for sweets although she was getting bigger,
plumper by the day.
Denver had joined in the play,
holding back a bit out of habit,
even
though it was the most fun she had ever known.
But once Sethe had seen the scar,
the tip of which Denver had been looking at whenever Beloved undressed--the little
curved shadow of a smile in the kootchy-kootchy-coo place under her chin--once Sethe saw it,
fingered it and
closed
her eyes for a long time,
the two of them cut Denver out of the games.
The cooking games,
the sewing games,
the hair
dressing-up games.
Games her mother loved so well she took to going to work later and
later each day until the
predictable happened:
Sawyer told her not to come back.
And instead of looking for another job,
Sethe played all the
harder with Beloved,
who never got enough of anything:
lullabies,
new stitches,
the bottom of the cake bowl,
the top
of the milk.
If the hen had only two eggs,
she got both.
But different because,
unlike Baby Suggs,
she cut Denver out
completely.
Even the song that
she used to sing to Denver she sang for Beloved alone:
"High Johnny,
wide Johnny,
you leave my side,
Johnny.
At first they played together.
A whole month and
Denver loved it.
From the night they ice-skated under a star-loaded
sky and
drank sweet milk by the stove,
to the string puzzles Sethe did for them in afternoon light,
shadow pictures
In the very teeth of winter and
her eyes fever bright,
was plotting a garden of vegetables and
flowers--talking,
talking about what colors it would have.
She played with Beloved's hair,
braiding,
puffing,
tying,
oiling it
until it made Denver nervous to watch her They changed beds and
exchanged clothes.
Walked arm in arm and

When it became clear that
were only interested in each other,
Denver began to drift from the play,
but she watched it,
alert for any sign that
Beloved was in danger.
Finally convinced there was none,
seeing her mother that
happy,
smiling--how could it
go wrong?
Her eye was
on her mother,
for a signal that
the thing that
was in her was out,
she would kill again.
But it was Beloved who made
demands.
Anything she wanted she got,
Sethe ran out of things to give her,
Beloved invented desire.
She wanted

flattened herself on the ground,
dirtying her bold stripes,
touched the rocking faces with her own.
Then the mood changed and
the arguments began.
Slowly at first.
A complaint from Beloved,
an apology from Sethe.
A reduction of pleasure at some special effort the older woman
made.
Wasn't it too cold to stay outside?
Beloved gave a look that
So what?
Was it past bedtime,
the light no good
for sewing?
Beloved did not move;
"Do it," and
Sethe complied.
She took the best of everything--first.
The best chair,
crawling on her knees to a lean-to.
None of which made the impression it was supposed to.
Beloved accused her of
136
That her plan was always that
would all be together on the other side,
forever.
Beloved wasn't interested.
She said when
she cried there was no one.
That dead men lay on top of her.
That she had nothing to eat.
Ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in her and
beloved in the dark and
bitch in the light.
Sethe pleaded for forgiveness,
counting,
listing again and
again her reasons:
Beloved was more important,
meant more to her than her own life.
That she would trade places any day.
Give up her life,
every minute and
hour of it,
to take back just one of Beloved's
tears.
Did she know it hurt her when
mosquitoes bit her baby?
That to leave her on the ground to run into the big house
drove her crazy?
That before leaving Sweet Home Beloved slept every night on her chest or curled on her back?
denied it.
Sethe never came to her,
never said a word to her,
never smiled and
worst of all never waved goodbye or
even looked her way before running away from her.
When once or twice Sethe tried to assert herself--be the unquestioned mother whose word was law and
who knew
what was best--Beloved slammed things,
wiped the table clean of plates,
threw salt on the floor,
broke a windowpane.
She was not like them.
She was wild game,
nobody said,
Get on out of here,
girl,
come back when
you get some
Honor thy mother and
father that
thy days may be long upon the land
which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
I will
wrap you round that
doorknob,
don't nobody work for you and
God don't love ugly ways.
They mended the plates,
swept the salt,
little by little it dawned on Denver that
if Sethe did not wake up
one morning and
pick up a knife,
Beloved might.
Frightened as she was by the thing in Sethe that
could come out,
shamed her to see her mother serving a girl not much older than herself.
When she saw her carrying out Beloved's night
bucket,
Denver raced to relieve her of it.
But the pain was unbearable when
they ran low on food,
Denver watched
Once she saw her run her longest finger deep in an empty jam jar before rinsing
putting it away.
They grew tired,
even Beloved,
who was getting bigger,
seemed nevertheless as exhausted as they were.
In any case
she substituted a snarl or a tooth-suck for waving a poker around and
124 was quiet.
Listless and
sleepy with hunger Denver saw the flesh between her mother's forefinger and
thumb fade.
Saw Sethe's eyes
bright but dead,
alert but vacant,
paying attention to everything about Beloved--her lineless palms,
her forehead,
smile under her jaw,
crooked and
much too long--everything except her basket-fat stomach.
She also saw the sleeves
of her own carnival shirtwaist cover her fingers;
hems that
once showed her ankles now swept the floor.
She saw
themselves beribboned,
decked-out,
limp and
starving but locked in a love that
wore everybody out.
Then Sethe spit up
something she had not eaten and
it rocked Denver like gunshot.
The job she started out with,
protecting Beloved from
changed to protecting her mother from Beloved.
Now it was obvious that
her mother could die and
leave them
both and
what would Beloved do then?
Whatever was happening,
it only worked with three--not two--and
since neither
Beloved nor Sethe seemed to care what the next day might bring
(Sethe happy when
Beloved was;
Beloved lapping
devotion like cream),
Denver knew it was on her.
She would have to leave the yard;
step off the edge of the world,

Strengthened by the gifts of food,

neither Sethe nor Beloved questioned,
the women had arrived at a doomsday truce designed by the devil.

Sometimes she screamed,

wipe the jewels away.
Other times Beloved curled up on the floor,
her wrists between her knees,
stayed there for
hours.
Or she would go to the creek,
stick her feet in the water and
whoosh it up her legs.
Afrerward she would go to Sethe,
run her fingers over the woman's teeth while tears slid from her wide black eyes.
it seemed to Denver the thing was done:
Beloved bending over Sethe looked the mother,
Sethe the teething child,
for
other than those times when
Beloved needed her,
Sethe confined herself to a corner chair.
The bigger Beloved got,
smaller Sethe became;
the brighter
Beloved's eyes,
the more those eyes that
used never to look away became slits of sleeplessness.
Sethe no longer
combed her hair or splashed her face with water.
She sat in the chair licking her lips like a chastised child while Beloved
ate up her life,
took it,
swelled up with it,
grew taller on it.
And the older woman yielded it up without a murmur.
Denver served them both.
Washing,
cooking,
forcing,
cajoling her mother to eat a little now and
providing sweet
things for Beloved as often as she could to calm her down.
It was hard to know what she would do from minute to
minute.
When the heat got hot,
she might walk around the house naked or wrapped in a sheet,
her belly protruding like
a winning watermelon.
Denver thought she understood the connection between her mother and
Sethe was trying to make up for
the handsaw;
Beloved was making her pay for it.
But there would never be an end to that,
seeing her mother
diminished shamed and
infuriated her.
Yet she knew Sethe's greatest fear was the same one Denver had in the
beginning--that
Beloved might leave.
That before Sethe could make her understand
what it meant--what it took to drag
the teeth of that
saw under the little chin;
to feel the baby blood pump like oil in her hands;
to hold her face so her head
would stay on;
to squeeze her so she could absorb,
still,
the death spasms that
shot through that
adored body,
plump
sweet with life--Beloved might leave.
Leave before Sethe could make her realize that
worse than that--far worse-
- was what Baby Suggs died of,
what Ella knew,
what Stamp saw and
what made Paul D tremble.
Oh no.
Maybe Baby Suggs could worry about it,
live with the likelihood of it;
Sethe had refused--and
refused still.
This and
much more Denver heard her say from her corner chair,
trying to persuade Beloved,
the one and
only person
she felt she had to convince,
what she had done was right because it came from true love.
her fat new feet propped on the seat of a chair in front of the one she sat in,
her unlined hands resting on
her stomach,
looked at her.
Uncomprehending everything except that
Sethe was the woman who took her face away,
Decided to stop relying on kindness to leave something on the stump.
She would hire herself out somewhere,
although she was afraid to leave Sethe and
Beloved alone all day not knowing what calamity either one of them would
create,
she came to realize that
her presence in that
house had no influence on what either woman did.
She kept them

they chose;
sulked,

strutted,
cowered,

She had begun to notice that
Beloved was quiet,
minding her own business,
Sethe got her going again.
Whispering,
muttering some justification,
some bit of
clarifying information to Beloved to explain what it had been like,
how come.
It was as though Sethe did not
really want forgiveness given;
she wanted it refused.
And Beloved helped her out.
Somebody had to be saved,
but unless Denver got work,
there would be no one to save,
no one to come home to,
no Denver either.
Cogitation,
as she called it,
clouded things and

she wouldn't have liked it if
they had,

Standing alone on the porch,

Urbino's love for Fermina was never as spiritually chaste as Florentino Ariza's was,

Setting
The story occurs mainly in an unnamed port city somewhere near the Caribbean Sea and
the Magdalena River.
Major themes
Narrative as seduction
Some critics choose to consider Love in the Time of Cholera as a sentimental story about the enduring power of true love.
Others criticize this opinion as being too simple.
García Márquez himself said in an interview,
"you have to be careful not
[4]
Narrative as deconstruction
The novel examines romantic love in myriad forms,
both "ideal" and
"depraved",
continually forces the reader to
question such ready-made characterizations by introducing elements antithetical to these facile judgments.
Love as an emotional and
physical disease
García Márquez's main notion is that
lovesickness is literally an illness,
a disease comparable to cholera.
Florentino suffers
from this just as he might suffer from any malady.
English adjective choleric has the same meaning.
Considering this meaning,
the title is a pun:
cholera as the disease,
cholera as passion,
which raises the central question of the book:
is love helped or hindered by extreme passion?
The two
men can be contrasted as the extremes of passion:
one having too much,
one too little;
the central question of which is
more conducive to love and
happiness becomes the specific,
personal choice that
Fermina faces through her life.
Florentino's passionate pursuit of nearly countless women stands in contrast to Urbino's clinical discussion of male
anatomy on their wedding night.
Jeremiah Saint-Amour's death inspires Urbino to meditate on his own death,
especially on the infirmities that
precede
it.
It is necessary for Fermina and
Florentino to transcend not only the difficulties of love,
but also the societal opinion that
love is a young person's prerogative
(not to mention the physical difficulties of love when
one is older).

Love
In the prologue,
Rustaveli describes three types of love:
an inaccessible due to the divine,
heavenly love;
physical love;
finally,
a higher earthly love or passionate love.
[32] Rustaveli thinks that
pure and
constant love does not expect love in
return.
[33] Such kind of love can not be felt without a strong spirit and
the only possibility of experiencing love of this order
is determined by the natural qualities that
should have a real human being.
Therefore,
the valiant must have its beautiful
with impeccable behavior including a constant devotion,
the rejection of social duties and
selfless loyalty.
And as the
author puts it "love is a severe trial for man as for woman".

10/27/2017 Toni Morrison - Wikipedia
In 1987 Morrison published her most celebrated novel,
Beloved.
It was inspired by the true story of an enslaved African-
American woman,
Margaret Garner,
[20] a piece of history that
Morrison had discovered when
compiling The Black Book.
daughter but was captured before she could kill herself.
[21] Morrison's novel imagines the dead baby returning as a ghost,
to haunt her mother and
family.
Beloved was a critical success,
a best-seller for 25 weeks.
New York Times book reviewer Michiko Kakutani wrote that
the scene of the mother killing her baby is ''so brutal and
disturbing that
it appears to warp time before and
after into a
Morrison's versatility and
technical and
emotional range appear to know no bounds.
If there were any doubts about her
stature as a pre-eminent American novelist,
of her own or any other generation,
'Beloved' will put them to rest.
"[23]
Not all critics praised Beloved,
however.
African-American conservative social critic Stanley Crouch,
for instance,
complained in his review in The New Republic [24] that
the novel "reads largely like a melodrama lashed to the structural
commercials".
[25][26]
Despite overall high acclaim,
Beloved failed to win the prestigious National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle
Award.
Forty-eight black critics and
writers,[27][28] among them Maya Angelou,
protested the omission in a statement that
yet to receive the national recognition that
her five major works of fiction entirely deserve," they wrote.
[3]
Two months later,
Beloved won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
[22] It also won an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.
That same
year,
Morrison took a visiting professorship at Bard College.
Beloved is the first of three novels about love and
African-American history,
sometimes called the Beloved Trilogy.
[31]
Morrison has said they are intended to be read together,
explaining,
"The conceptual connection is the search for the
beloved – the part of the self that
is you,
loves you,
is always there for you.
"[5]
The second novel in the trilogy,
Jazz,
came out in 1992.
Told in language that
imitates the rhythms of jazz music,
the novel
is about a love triangle during the Harlem Renaissance in New York City.
That year she also published her first book of
literary criticism,
Playing in the Dark:
Whiteness and
the Literary Imagination
(1992),
an examination of the African-
Letters,
which is awarded to a writer "who has enriched our literary heritage over a life of service,
or a corpus of work.
"[38]
The third of her Beloved trilogy,
Paradise,
about citizens of an all-black town,
came out in 1997.
The next year,
Morrison
was on the cover of Time magazine,
only the second female and
second black writer of fiction to appear on what was
magazine cover of the era.
[39]
Beloved Onscreen,
Also in 1998,
the movie adaptation of Beloved was released,
directed by Jonathan Demme and
co-produced by Oprah
Winfrey,
who had spent ten years bringing it to the screen.
Winfrey also stars as the main character,

alongside
Danny Glover as Sethe's lover,

deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel.
…Its linchpin is of course Oprah Winfrey,
who had the clout and

to bring 'Beloved' to the screen and
has the dramatic presence to hold it together.

In 1996 television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey had selected Song of Solomon for her newly launched Book Club,

those who asked the question 'Toni Morrison again?
'… I say with certainty there would have been no Oprah's Book Club if
this woman had not chosen to share her love of words with the world.

Morrison continued to explore new art forms when
she returned to Margaret Garner's life story,

Completed in 2002,
with music by Richard Danielpour,
the opera was performed by the New York City Opera in 2007.

Oxford University awarded her an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in June 2005.
In 2006,
The New York Times Book Review named Beloved the best work of American fiction published in the previous
25 years,
as chosen by a selection of prominent writers,
literary critics,
editors.
[49] In his essay about the choice,
Scott said,
"Any other outcome would have been startling,
since Morrison's novel has
inserted itself into the American canon more completely than any of its potential rivals.
With remarkable speed,
has,
less than 20 years after its publication,
become a staple of the college literary curriculum,
which is to say a classic.
Kottiswari writes in Postmodern Feminist Writers
(2008)
that
Morrison exemplifies characteristics of "postmodern
feminism" by "altering Euro-American dichotomies by rewriting a history written by mainstream historians" and
by her
usage of shifting narration in Beloved and

In 1930 he began five years as a schoolmaster in boys' schools:
two years at the Larchfield Academy in
Helensburgh,
Scotland,
then three years at the Downs School in the Malvern Hills,
where he was a much-loved teacher.

At the Downs,
in June 1933,
he experienced what he later described as a "Vision of Agape",
while sitting with three fellow-
teachers at the school,

he said,
later influenced his decision to return to the Anglican Church in 1940.

Around this time,

I think this analogy is now in serious danger of breaking down,

A few days earlier I had had a dream.
We talked earnestly and
cheerfully to the press about the project.
Here was a bird,
we explained,
that
was in its way as extraordinary and
unique as the most famous extinct animal of all - the dodo - and
it was itself poised on the brink of extinction.
It would be far better if it could be famously loved as a survivor than famously regretted,
like the dodo.
This seemed to cause some movement within the Department of Conservation,
it transpired that
those within it who supported us won their case.
A day or two later we were standing on the Tarmac of Invercargill airport at the very south of South island,
waiting for a helicopter.
We quickly discovered that
we had fallen in with a bunch of passionately obsessed people.
The first obsession for Carl and
for Richard was birds.
They loved them with an extraordinary fervour,
had devoted their entire adult lives to working in the field,
often in awful conditions and
on horribly low budgets,
to save rare birds,
the environments they live in,
from extinction.
Richard had trained in the Philippines,
working to save the Philippines monkey-eating eagle,
a wildly improbable looking piece of flying hardware that
you would more readily expect to see coming in to land
on an aircraft carrier than nesting in a tree.
From there he had,
in 1985,
come to Mauritius,
where the entire ecology of an island
formerly famous for its abundant beauty is in desperate trouble.
He should be the one to show you.
He took us for a quick hunt,
but Carl wasn't there.
There was,
however,
someone who was besottedly in love with him.
Richard beckoned us in.
`This is Pink,' he said.
'What do you mean?
one of the problems with breeding birds in captivity is that
they sometimes have to be reared by humans,
which leads to all sorts of misunderstandings on the bird's part.
When a bird hatches from its egg it doesn't have much of a clear picture of what's what in the world,
it falls in love with the first thing that
feeds it,
which in Pink's case was Carl.
It's called "imprinting" and
it's a major problem because you can't undo it.

I'm only interested in Truth and
Beauty!
' But somehow,
he found that
the more wrinkles he counted on his forehead and
the more problems he had with his continence and
his seven-times table,
the more he found a little flattery most welcome.
'I loved your Pandax Building with the interchangeable rooms and
total reassembly potential!
' shouted a young cub reporter with soft eyes and
a delightful cleavage.
'Thank you.
There was a clang and
the robot fell backwards onto the highly decorative marble floor.
'Here you may see the Grand
Axial Canal,
Second Class!
' it announced proudly and
extended a whitegloved hand
at the ceiling.
The Journalist made another note in his thumb-recorder.
Leovinus's reaction to the robot's minor mishap was also noted down in The Journalist's thumb-recorder.
From the Central Well of the Starship ran two great canals - one to the fore and
one to the aft.
These partly had the effect of cooling the engines,
but were also elegant recreational facilities.
Up and
down the canal,
gondolas plied their way,
the automated gondoliers each singing their own personal selection of Blerontinian folk-songs - but particularly the one about the beautiful young female acrobat who fell in love with a gondolier and
gave him six pnedes
(approximately one million pounds sterling)
as a tip.
Leovinus was doing his from-blank-disbelief-to-cold-fury routine again.
The Journalist took note.
What shall we do?
Titania!
The genius of Leovinus was nowhere so evident as in this - his last and
best-loved creation;
Titania was the brains of the ship and
her statue appeared everywhere on board - serving as the eyes and
ears and
communicating essence of the ship's intelligence.
But the ship's intelligence was also imbued with emotional life as well.
And this is where Leovinus had excelled himself.
Leovinus sprinted up the staircase,
two steps at a time.
His mind focused on one thought:
The love of his old age.
The obsession of his ageing heart:
intelligent,
kind,
wise,
caring,
serene,
warm ..
Leovinus glanced down and
realised that
one of Titania's incredibly delicate cerebral arteries - the central intelligence core of Titania's brain - was lying against his foot.
'You're destroying her!
Brobostigon pushed Leovinus off him,
and
the old man staggered back and
fell onto the floor across the outspread wings of his beloved creature.
'You're blind,
Leovinus!
You sit up there in your ivory tower,
thinking you're too high-minded and
pure to deal with grubby things like business and
finance!
I'll cut a deal with you!
The workman turned on him:
'I'm really very upset!
I loved that
parrot.
'You tell me everything you know about the Starship and
I'll not tell Star-Struct Inc.
about the parrot.
'I don't know whether you've noticed,
Einstein...
' there was sheer joy in Nigel's voice.
He loved ridiculing his girlfriends.
'But it's night.
''Sright!
'Yes!
' cried Nettle.
'I'd love to!
'Come with me,
madam,' said the Thing From Outer Space and
turned smartly back into the ruined house.
'Well?
Wide columns marked out the elegantly curved walls,
burning braziers dotted the canal embankments.
All over the canal,
automated gondolas plied lazily back and
forth,
their robot gondoliers singing pleasantly - a song that
brought harmony and
peace to the main thoroughfare of the Starship Titanic:
'She gave him love!
She swung above!
She kissed him on his smiling handsome lip.
She had made sure his diary was up to date and
that
he looked at it.
She'd made him change his socks every day and
had washed his underpants by hand.
She must love him a lot!
And yet she knew he'd just gone out of her life...
Not just because they'd been kidnapped by an alien starship full of robots...
' But the Ancient Creature,
whom Dan had rightly identified as Nettie,
couldn't reply.
The moment they passed into the First Class Section,
she collapsed and
lay as if dead.
The Gap T-shirt hung around her shrunken frame like an over-large pullover.
Her jewellery looked foolish and
ill-advised on her scrawny wrists and
neck.
What on Earth - or off the Earth - had happened to her?
What had in fact happened was this.
The Starship Titanic was powered by the latest and
most incredible invention of the great Leovinus's genius.
No one knew how he had done it,
he had kept it an absolute secret,
but somehow he harnessed for the Starship - his beloved masterpiece - the vastest source of power in the probable Universe:
a captive Black Hole.
Naturally something as powerful as a Black Hole needed very careful handling and
had to be surrounded by incredible safety precautions.
Unfortunately,
safety was one thing that
neither Scraliontis nor Brobostigon had first in their minds,
when
they began to reduce the specifications for the construction of the ship.
'He helped to chalk
Her tight-rope walk
So that
the lovely lady wouldn't slip.
Dan had always hated opera.
'Let's go somewhere quiet,' he whispered to Nettie,
finally lifted her up and
staggered into the nearest doorway.
'Oh God!
' she cried.
'I love you!
And before The Journalist realized what was happening,
Lucy was on top of him,
kissing his mouth and
pulling her fingers through his hair.
'Ow!
'I had to tell you!
I had to!
I've always loved you!
That's what's been missing!
Ah!
' cried The Journalist.
'I love yooooou!
' cried Lucy.
'Ooooooooh!
' echoed The Journalist and
the two of them collapsed together as the clock clicked to zero...
They lay there waiting for the forever-ending explosion that
would terminate their brief affair.
But,
unlike the two lovers,
it did not come.
'What's happened?
' Lucy was the first to speak.
'Five minutes!
' thought Dan.
'This is where,
in a cheap novel,
the couple - confronted by imminent oblivion - would suddenly make passionate love.
'You've got to go and
talk to it!
' she pleaded.
Then there's a thing called "the engagement" where rings are exchanged.
Finally there's an elaborate ceremony called "a wedding" with a cake and
"bridesmaids" and
the "best man's speech" - not to mention the "honeymoon"!
You wouldn't believe the rigmarole we have to go through in order to make love to each other.
I like your Earth way of doing it much better.
'The bomb still might go off any second!
' continued the bomb even though they were out of the room.
That was one theory out of the way,
thought Lucy,
disentangling herself from The Journalist's embrace.
Back in the room,
she stared at the bomb and
tried to think,
but it was hard with an alien sticking his tongue in her ear and
saying he loved her more than anything on his world.
'Please,
The!
' exclaimed Lucy.
One thousand...
Nine hundred and
ninety-nine...
' said The Journalist.
'You're all I've ever dreamed about.
'We've got to make the Captain take us back to Earth now!
' And he was off out of the Engine Room and
racing back down the Grand
Axial Canal towards the front of the ship.
'Look - it was great making love with you,' Lucy said to The Journalist,
who was now standing behind her and
attempting to fondle her breasts again,
'but we've got to get back to the real world!
Our real world.
' And she tried to remove his hands from her blouse.
You are so unpleasant!
'I'm merely stating the facts.
if you really want to know the facts:
I never made love to Jurgen Zenzendorf.
'I wasn't talking about Jurgen Zenzendorf!
' Trust Lucy,
to bring up another case that
she could defend instead of the one they were actually talking about.
'I'm here,
Lucy!
'But I never seem to get through to you.
'And I love you,' replied Dan,
he kissed her,
she felt how far away he really was.
'Oh,
Dan,
let's get married,' she said.
sure.
He nodded,
a couple of Yassaccan repair workers hurried over to replace them.
Bolfass had led his Special Assault Group along a back service corridor to the crew's quarters,
while Yellin and
Assmal led the frontal attack along the main arteries of the Starship.
Bolfass loved the finish they had obtained on the service corridor ceiling.
It gave him much quiet satisfaction,
in the dark of the night,
to reflect on the craftsmanship and
the high quality of material lavished on even the working areas of the great Starship.
'Never was there another such construction in the entire history of our people,' he used to tell his grandchildren,
as they sat around the evening hearth,
eating their dumpling stew and
snork crackling.
'Even the curtains in the Crew Rooms were woven from the hair of the silky canadil,
which lives high up in the Mountains of Merlor,
can only be caught with love and
kindness.
The hair of the canadil is so fine you must weave it by the light of the moons,
for in sunlight it will disappear like snow.
' The children loved these tales of craftsmanship and
daring feats of engineering.
It cut Bolfass to the quick to see how someone could mistreat such workmanship.
In fact it made him very cross indeed.
- - - - - -
But before he could wreak his terrible and
destructive revenge on the perpetrators of this slipshod botch-work a miracle happened.
The door of the Crew Room opened and
a vision entered - someone so compellingly and
so unutterably beautiful that
Bolfass fell heavily and
permanently in love.
His life was never to be the same from that
moment forth.
He lowered the SD gun and
stared in childlike adoration.
Nettie,
who had just completed her course of rejuvenation in Leovinus's extraordinary beauty parlour,
had not only regained her youthful complexion,
her body also had returned to its former proportions.
In fact,
if anything,
her waist was just that
little bit thinner,
her breasts just a tiny bit firmer,
the swell of her stomach just a tad more rounded.
She looked more lovely than ever for,
despite the fresh bloom of youth that
had returned to her cheeks,
her face was also suffused with the wisdom that
comes of having lived for several million years.
Old Leovinus certainly knew what he was doing.
D'you think your other friend - what's her name?
'She suggested...
you make love?
'The blonde one - Nightie!
in all those years he couldn't remember Lucy initiating a single sexual act.
In the early years,
he would sometimes lie awake at night,
waiting to see if she would start,
but he finally gave up.
She was always perfectly happy to make love - but he had to make the first approach.
He'd always assumed that
was just how she was.
'Hey!
'Suppose you tell me everything you know about this Starship that
we're all stuck on,
then maybe together we can figure a way to get off it.
' shouted Lucy from her cell.
'I love you too!
' Dan shouted back.
'Me too!
Captain Bolfass had escorted the beautiful Nettie to the Captain's Bridge.
There he had invited her to take a little tea and
some cinnamon biscuit,
while he made the necessary arrangements to fly the great Starship back to the planet Earth.
'Without wishing to sound disrespectful,' he explained to her,
'it is not a planet with which I am familiar - though,
of course,
it must be the most delightful world,
to be the home of someone as lovely and
as charming as yourself.
' He bowed,
Nettie felt the thrill of being treated like the heroine of Northanger Abbey.
'I am sure you are more than capable of guiding us home,' she said,
lowering her eyes.
'Very well!
You leave me no choice!
' snarled Bolfass and
he struck The Journalist across the face with his leather glove.
'All right!
'Men!
You hear the seriousness of this situation.
Our beloved home of Yassacca has been ruined by the construction of this Starship and
the failure of the Blerontinians to honour their debts.
We built in good faith.
We put our entire way of life at risk to construct the most fabulous and
beautiful starcraft the Galaxy has ever seen.
I'll be all right .
' sighed the Captain.
(On Yassacca,
being 'in love' was considered a form of illness.
But the old Yassaccan songs that
the band
were now playing caused the Captain to sigh again and
again and
even brought a tear to his eye.
They were ancient songs of yearning for better tools and
materials,
songs of lament for construction projects that
were never finished,
songs of regret for the great craftsmen of yesteryear who would never plane nor chisel again.
she couldn't help feeling he was overdoing it.
We love each other - don't we?
'I don't know,' replied Dan.
'Do we?
'We can't get back to Earth and
even if we could,
the hotel's a pile of rubble!
'But we've got the money from Top Ten Travel!
' 'But that
doesn't mean we love each other!
' 'But we do!
We've been together all this time!
'How d'you know all that?
The Navigational Officer smiled smugly as he took off his translatorspecs and
said:
'It's written on the estate agents' board.
' He loved baffling beautiful but not too bright females.
Right...
We must have been fooling each other for years...
About all sorts of things.
You know I was originally in love with Nigel?
' Lucy was letting the sea wash around her bare feet.
'Till you realized what a shit he was?
' smiled The Journalist.
'We can have a real Blerontinian White Wedding.
You'll love it.
Dan raised his eyes heavenwards and
Nettie smiled,
as the cover of the landing craft was placed over them.
Captain Bolfass retreated to the viewing chamber;
the side of the great Starship opened,
the tiny landing craft blasted itself away towards the blue planet.
'Did I see what?
Nettie was suddenly overwhelmed by the hopelessness of it all.
Here was a whole world - a whole civilization so much more advanced than her own - depending on her eliciting a sensible answer from this creep whom she'd once been in love with.
What a hope in hell!
She might as well try and
teach Turkish to the cat!
Now,
as he stared round at the bare walls of his cell,
he realized that
he'd been talking through his bottom.
No one could hide behind the pretensions of creativity when
people were actually suffering - maybe even dying - because of it.
He remembered the two cub reporters with their lovely smiles and
alluring cleavages...
How he had felt so superior to them...
How he'd believed deep down that
no one was good enough for him.
Full stop.
It was pathetic,
now he looked back.
Had he been loved?
Had he loved?
And here,
had you been eavesdropping outside the great man's cell
(as indeed Constable Hackett was doing)
then you would have heard a terrible groan rise up from the Greatest Genius The Galaxy Had Ever Known,
as he remembered how his love and
affection had been focussed not on a living creature - not on a wife - not on a lover - not even on a pet snorkling!
- but on an agglomeration of wires and
neurons,
sensors and
cybernetic pathways - Titania - his last,
his greatest,
his absolute obsession!
'But she loves me!
' he cried from the depths of his despair.
'But she is not real...
he turned back to Nettie.
'Dear lady!
Do you think you could ever love me?
'YOU CAN'T HAVE THROWN IT AWAY!
' screamed the remarkably attractive and
available female alien.
'We've still got twenty minutes to go!
Leovinus gazed into her beautiful face.
Her eyelids fluttered,
slowly she opened her lovely eyes and
gazed back at him.
He had slipped the missing cerebral artery - the central intelligence core - into Titania's brain as gently as he could.
He knew the shudder of life that
would run through her would bring both joy and
pain,
as unused neurons and
dormant cybernetic pathways pulsed into new life.
' whispered the old man.
'I still love you.
Dan and
the others gasped as the beautiful creature raised her head off the floor,
leant up on one elbow,
then - her hair spilling around her shoulders - rose majestically,
powerfully and
sat as she had always been designed to sit,
with her chin resting thoughtfully upon her hand.
Titania had come to life and
the Starship Titanic was finally complete.
Nettie herself couldn't believe her luck when
Lucy went off and
married The Journalist.
She immediately felt free to propose to Dan,
he couldn't believe his luck either.
The two of them became not only lovers but best friends.
Nettie took a degree in Higher Mathematics,
was able to help old Leovinus on some of his later works.
She made so much money out of this that
she and
Dan were able to rebuild the old rectory and
turn it into a relaxed family hotel specializing in Central Galactic cuisine.

But it was my first time,
so the gloves that
I made were terribly misshapen!
Riiight,
they were huge...
Oh,
no,
it was nothing!
Do you remember what you did with those gloves?
You did not wear them on your claws...
You put them on your ears!
So I just did what I had to and
tried to look after her as best I could.
Somehow,
thankfully,
she grew up to be that
bright beam of sunshine we all know
love.
Her only fault is that
she can sometimes be a bit too tomboyish,

These aren't hard to produce when
your town is perfect,
but they are impossible otherwise to attain.
The other two flower-weeds--clovers and
dandelions--occasionally sprout in your town,
though they are indiscriminate of your town's status.
They are both mildly undesirable,
Dandelions can transform into Dandelion Puffs over time.

Plants other than flowers can also appear in your town.
Dandelions,
dandelion
puffs,
and
clovers will appear randomly in town from late February into early
December.
Dandelions will not remain dandelions for long.
They will turn into
dandelion puffs,
as if you had blown on one,
scattering the seeds.
Clovers
often act as whithering flowers do.
They will often disintegrate if you

it doesn't disappear,
you have

an item that
you can wear in your hair.

This is one of the best
looking attacks in the game and
it can also be devastating in a fight and
cause a gameover.
This doesn't sound major to some players but to others who love the 1 death challenge this is
quite critical.
For the few and
the proud you want to either have a Thunder Helm,
topaz earrings or some prepared electro simmered fruit food.
However as always ice attacks can 1-2 shot kill these enemies after a freeze and

weapons in the game and
with this perk,
you no longer have to worry about

If you love grenades,

you might as well use a Missile Launcher

Starting suggestion:
(and
quickly raise to 4 with a bobblehead)
If you really love VATS:
5+
through 6 to get the best ones,
although you can start at 5 since the
bobblehead is about as hard as the STR one to find.
If you love power
armor,
you will eventually want to get to 9,
but for everyone else,
6 is
plenty.
Starting suggestion if you love sneaking:
It's that
good.
Learn it,
love it.
Some say that
because you have the option of
getting a companion who can do this for you,
you don't need it.
looking to be a VATS-loving death machine,
check out luck instead.
If
you can't do luck and
just love PER for some reason,
then sure - take
this instead.
Rating:
Even if you don't
sneak much I'd still recommend sneak if you can fit it in your build,
but
if you just love running around and
hate taking more time to do things
feel free to skip.
or 0 if you just hate sneaking

If you want to make sure you kill everything in a single

you love the ranged sneak attacks,

When discussing with Teddy,
Longfellow loves the

likes "minimize the damage".
Nick dislikes the
any motive-related option makes him aggro.
(He also has a speech check to
reveal his love for Gilda...
although the 1200+ paintings should've made
that
obvious.
Considering two of the best
unique weapons
(Old Reliable,
Sergeant Ash)
are in his possession,
other
factions give no discounts,
this is a lovely prize.
Just don't expect lavish
praise from the grump afterwards.
Longfellow doesn't react either way.
When confronting Aubert about her note,
Nick dislikes extortion caps from
her;
trading the note and
telling her to run are loved and
liked options,
respectively.
Longfellow only likes taking her caps
