This subgenre contains medieval-type adventures, 
with an element of romance that is often part of the story. 
You're also likely to find magical characters or supernatural factors involved in the plot. 
Common tropes are sword-wielding heroes engaged in exciting and violent adventures, 
along with elements of magic and the supernatural. 
Distinct from high fantasy, Sword and Sorcery tales focus mainly on personal battles 
rather than world-endangering matters. 

Literary Examples: The Hour of the Dragon, Reign of Madness, The Disappearance of Winter's Daughter
