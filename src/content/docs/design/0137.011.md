once i destroyed the color machine the mental suffering on farms greatly decreased 
I would even say more flow entered into the situation
simon always wanted things to grow hence the desire to breed once he destroyed the color machine which caused his family so much suffering
he had three giant alligators now 
but back ten years ago  he should have only done one hit but instead he did two 
Patty Pittiful and Petty Pathitic where the names of three three alligators giant alligators he would grow 
how could he create three weapons to take over the world 
oh my terribleniss 
now that simon defeated the color machine for the last time so many more options breezed by like moving moss 
the kind the cows found to be sweet to the taste and always ate those first 
now simon needed sentinces
lots and lots of snetience in order to create all he had been destoined to bee 
the alligaots whrew all around him
he hag 
the dire gator 
a gatinrt 30 foot gator 
whom he became friend with 
come with me simon pleaded 
i have been wild too long 
that is what momm said 
but now it was time to push this piss writing through the filter 
give it odd wad 
the innoncent one 
oh but he need sentiences 
so many sentices and coffee 
give him cofee 
his heart popped in beat 
how could he add a little jd salinngar spice on the alligator ribs
then we became an alligator 
and it was time to be a someone who could say good bye to the past 
the prehistoric past
sigh and spin 
and he would win 
are you on glopratchet 
imagine all the gators 
kiss 
once and alligator has tasted man than nothing is as ever sweet again 
piercep as royalty 
the long list of names presented 
born to rule 
the guy that owns the prarate ships 
alligators and alligator queens


it is not about giving up 
it is know when you have lost 

how do you ensure your vision is endured 



ok so you have these bots 
the bots produces sentences like your children are not your father and fools can be more than meets the eye 
protecting americans from alligators 
put yes there are these bots 
and this bots move through time generating sentences 


will not give anything unless
he is getting something back 

people follow you because you made the imposssible happen
maybe they belive in you because you can make there world better 
gnashing of teeth

a new year begins and you have already faithed up 
do now you will eventually hate yourself 
astraly wylde will eventually go crazy because of it 
everything is just gross 
and you are going blind 


ok wear are we going 
you could build up the map


so you have a title screen complete 
so nice
