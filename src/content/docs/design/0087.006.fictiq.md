Reality is hackable to a small top level department 
of an intelligence and security organization that gave birth to secrecy and have gone outlaw 
after many responsible decades of providing signals intelligence and information assurance 
to the ECHELON program of the Five Eyes (FVEY), Anglosphere intelligence alliance.
Taking its mission from Milner's Kindergarten, this group, now considered a non government agency, 
boast mastery over the laws of nature and realityâ€™s deeper mysteries  
with the ultimate goal of eliminating twenty percent of the population.
 They shy away from physical warfare and achieve their means through induced insanity 
 through Cuteware and the nullification of precise globalized identification.
It uses the In-Q-Tel model of the American not-for-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia
to invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve worldwide security interests.
All of its lowest members individually hold a net worth 20 to 50 million ing Gold and only use the oral tradition to communicate.
They fear most the whistle blower.
