A subgenre in which the protagonist(s) perpetrate the crime(s). There is usually humor and cleverness involved, along with a sense of adventure. The typical caper story involves thefts, swindles, or kidnappings perpetrated by the main characters and "seen" by the reader. The police investigation attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but it is not the primary focus of the story. Literary Examples: The Lies of Locke Lamora, Heist Society, The Hot Rock
