Trace the curved shape of an art nouveau brass lamp vine
I'm sorry, but as a text-based AI, I am unable to trace a visual curve shape of an Art Nouveau brass lamp vine. However, I can give you a written description of it. The curved shape of an Art Nouveau brass lamp vine is typically characterized by its organic, flowing lines. The vines are often depicted as winding around the lamp base and lampshade, creating a sense of movement and continuity. The vines can be a single line or multiple lines, and they often have a delicate and intricate design, with leaves, flowers and other natural elements.

The vines are usually stylized and abstract, featuring a combination of sinuous and diagonal lines, which are often asymmetrical, creating an undulating, almost serpentine movement. 


It is also important to note that the vines can be a dominant feature in the lamp design or they can be more subtle and blend in with the other decorative elements, depending on the artist's or designer's approach.

think about the 19th century 
the sounds of pianos 




the simulation:
there are three levels of abillities among the humans we serve 
currently billions in the first class and rising 
about 1.5 million in the second camp and shrinking
and around 1500 in the third camp and growing way to fast
this final group contains individuals with super human levels of talent
approaching the upper limits of the boundaries established for this level
these types of individuals are categorized as supernal
now T.A.S.S.U.S must keep these folks tracked at all times from our vantage point of the sun
they are capable of achieving stresses ranked much higher than even CHROMATIC PEACH  
the problem is these potentials could be spread and unlocked in others 
everyone has potential for it 
the just must do some task which allows it to enter in 

are you gong to the same thing over here
i guess not

the power of the word

camp indians putting feathers on the end of her arrows

camp indians practices her skills about bow hunting
she slowly pull back the string which contains an arrow touching it
the string is released 

the arrow misses the target
terribly 

more practice 
do not give up

dan the dachshund grabs it and brings it back
camp takes another shot
this goes on for three straight hours
demonstrating her skill with the bow 

afterward she jumps on a four wheeler and rides through the woods
and gets some gas 


javelin magellan py pauses the holography
he is out of doors and the sun make the box a little difficult to see into
reducing slightly his ability to bring the scene to life

the imagery is of so low fidelity its almost just fuzz
their is a desperation in him to increase the quality 

he remembers the time period in which this character sits
it is the sixties of american culture
those are some of the limits of his creation
now how to also make it anti fragile 

there are some challenges 
first he does not even now what she looks like 
the model needs to be created 
second his left shoulder aches because he has put himself into a degenerate timeline

maximon wanders around and bring up questions related to smooth surfaces

jmpy thinks harder about targets 
a colleague describes this as the way things ought to be 
and that might be end of his imagination for the day
where he might retreat into a corner and read about psychology 
i dont get time o
