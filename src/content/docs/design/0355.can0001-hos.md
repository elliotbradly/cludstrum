Sharon : Nicholas, you have to run.
Sharon : There is no other choice.
Nicholas : I did not do this.
Nicholas : I did not kill Blangus .
Sharon : I know that.
Sharon : I believe you now.
Nicholas : You didn't at first.
Nicholas : It took a lot of convincing.
Sharon : If it was that hard to convince me, then how are you going to get the police to believe you?
Nicholas : I know this sounds bad, it does.
Nicholas : Leaving the country is not the solution here.
Sharon : Honey, I thought it would be turning our life upside-down forever, but what other choice do we have?
Nicholas : Maybe Richards didn't jump to the con -- conclusion I did this.
Nicholas : They know everything Blangus did to me in the past.
Nicholas : Maybe it doesn't sound so crazy that he killed himself to set me up, especially since he was going to die anyway.
Sharon : I wish the D.
Sharon : A.
Sharon : could see it that way.
Nicholas : I guess it is a lot for them to swallow.
