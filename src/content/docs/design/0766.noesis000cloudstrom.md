are you gong to the same thing over here
i guess not

the power of the word

camp indians putting feathers on the end of her arrows

camp indians practices her skills about bow hunting
she slowly pull back the string which contains an arrow touching it
the string is released 

the arrow misses the target
terribly 

more practice 
do not give up

dan the dachshund grabs it and brings it back
camp takes another shot
this goes on for three straight hours
demonstrating her skill with the bow 


afterward she jumps on a four wheeler and rides through the woods
and gets some gas 



javelin magellan py pauses the holography
he is out of doors and the sun make the box a little difficult to see into
reducing slightly his ability to bring the scene to life

the imagery is of so low fidelity its almost just fuzz
their is a desperation in him to increase the quality 

he remembers the time period in which this character sits
it is the sixties of american culture
those are some of the limits of his creation
now how to also make it anti fragile 

there are some challenges 
first he does not even now what she looks like 
the model needs to be created 
second his left shoulder aches because he has put himself into a degenerate timeline

maximon wanders around and bring up questions related to smooth surfaces

jmpy thinks harder about targets 
a colleague describes this as the way things ought to be 
and that might be end of his imagination for the day
where he might retreat into a corner and read about psychology

A family setting around a long wooden dinning room table
Antique glassworks reflect light from a museum quality display case

KAREN:
You need to be eating 

ELLIOT :
Thank you for thinking of me 

ELLIOT BEEDLY, a balding middle age man sits in front of an adorable three year old girl, BITCOIN BEEDLY
KAREN BEEDLY The grandmother holding tightly to the last pearl of youth looks like she is about to pass out during the meal
ELLIOT BEEDLY clutches his chest tightly during a sudden shock of pain and looks at the little girl 

ELLIOT:
YouTube shared with me the prophecy the day after I bought it after a three week break.
I just did not love you enough back then or it would have all gone in the trash that spring instead of this winter 

BITCOIN stands up in her chair and laughs and laughs and laughs

Elliot begins to imagine his sister in the room instead of a cruise to the Bahamas 

KAREN:
Who said you could stand up 

ELLIOT:
You must stop doing this to your poor mother
Stop thinking about yourself, get her on some drugs, or find a better babysitter 

KAREN:
She only behaves this way around you 

ELLIOT:
I really wish I loved my mother 
I really wish she could have been a mother 
But then I remember sometimes she seems to be able to handle it

Back, back, back to your room

such a sunrise this morning 
the only problem was making sure to get to the best spot to watch it 
there was so much vapor in the air 
you could see where the edges of sun begins and ends 
a little calf about two feet high darts across the field throwing up a little kick of spite 
timing the movement at just the right moment as it passes in between the celestial bodies 
the orb moves so slowly but you can see it coming out of the pine trees and up into the sky 
where it transitions from pale to orange to brilliant yellow 
until at last the edges dissolve into color 
that burns your eyes to vapor

You have it backwards.
A power structure is not the means of maintaining power.
A power structure is the embodiment of power.
It is the formal means of exerting power.
A benefit for having a power structure is that it allows a ruler to concentrate power in one place
(within limits),
Of course,
if the power wasn't distributed correctly
and there was a totalitarian dictator,
a hyper-centralized empire,
that didn't distribute power,
then yes.

When death, the great
Reconciler, has come, it is never our tenderness that we repent of, but our
severity.

ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak, and not to please
themselves.’ There’s a text wants no candle to show’t; it shines by its own
light. It’s plain enough you get into the wrong road i’ this life if you run
after this and that only for the sake o’ making things easy and pleasant to
yourself. A pig may poke his nose into the trough and think o’ nothing
outside it; but if you’ve got a man’s heart and soul in you, you can’t be easy

That would be a pity; for I cannot pretend that Seth and Dinah were
anything else than Methodists — not indeed of that modern type which
reads quarterly reviews and attends in chapels with pillared porticoes, but of
a very old-fashioned kind. They believed in present miracles, in
instantaneous conversions, in revelations by dreams and visions; they drew
lots, and sought for Divine guidance by opening the Bible at hazard; having
a literal way of interpreting the Scriptures, which is not at all sanctioned by
approved commentators; and it is impossible for me to represent their
diction as correct, or their instruction as liberal. Still — if I have read
religious history aright — faith, hope, and charity have not always been
found in a direct ratio with a sensibility to the three concords, and it is
possible — thank Heaven! — to have very erroneous theories and very
sublime feelings.

But
Dinah walked as simply as if she were going to market, and seemed as
unconscious of her outward appearance as a little boy: there was no blush,
no tremulousness, which said, “I know you think me a pretty woman, too
young to preach”; no casting up or down of the eyelids, no compression of
the lips, no attitude of the arms that said, “But you must think of me as a
saint.” She held no book in her ungloved hands, but let them hang down
lightly crossed before her, as she stood and turned her grey eyes on the
people. There was no keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be
shedding love than making observations; they had the liquid look which
tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out, rather than impressed by
external objects. She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun,
and leafy boughs screened her from its rays; but in this sober light the
delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like
flowers at evening. It was a small oval face, of a uniform transparent
whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a
delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular brow, surmounted by a rising arch
of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn
straight back behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two above
the brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the
hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes, though
no darker, were long and abundant — nothing was left blurred or
unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers
with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar
beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so
gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting
away before their glance.

   The Wayfarers are the remains of an ancient human civilization that predates
the founding of the Dominion by millennia. These humans set out aboard
gigantic cylindrical ships towards the distant stars in an effort to colonize them.
This diaspora occurred before the discovery of Lightpacer drives, and some are
still in transit. Entire generations of Wayfarers have come and gone aboard these
ships, and each ship’s culture has diverged from the next. Many never reached
their destinations; others found their destination a barren system, incapable of
supporting life. Those who never found a suitable home continue to traverse the
vast distances between the stars. Two such ships are slowly making their journey
   Each of these two Wayfarer vessels is a gigantic, cylindrical generation ship
that spins to generate gravity and propels itself using a very primitive, reaction-
mass drive. Each vessel is built to be self-sufficient with a complete ecosystem to
support the population. Over the generations each vessel has suffered mishaps
and hardships that have changed not only the ship itself, but also the crew.
   The cultures of the two Wayfarer vessels are diametrically opposed, although
both have evolved along quasi-religious lines. The leaders of the Wayfarers on
the vessel Harmony are the Priesthood of the Keepers. The Keepers are the ruling
caste of priests that possess the requisite knowledge to maintain the vessel and
keep it running. The rest of the population reveres them and worships the vessel
as a life-giving deity. They live in relative peace amongst themselves and enjoy
a high quality of life, though their idyllic existence is frequently interrupted by
their cousins on the Discord. The population of the Harmony are always prepared
to defend themselves and their vessel from the Exiles of Discord.
   The other vessel, the Discord, is ruled by the Exiled Priesthood. Long ago, the
life support systems of the Discord began to fail, and the crew was unable to make
the necessary repairs, because they had been gradually losing knowledge over the
generations. As systems began to falter, the environment on the Discord became
polluted; some parts of the vessel became uninhabitable. The corridors drip with
moisture, and vegetation and mould grow on the walls. Radiation leaks from the
main reactor core. The crew has started to exhibit mutations from living in such
an environment.
   Many generations ago, the crew of the Discord attempted to join their cousins
on the Harmony, but they were not permitted. Since then, they have called
themselves the Exiled, and they launch raids on the Harmony in cobbled-together
shuttles to capture slaves, steal parts, and scrounge supplies. The Exiled Priesthood
has turned to practices that involve sacrifices to their dark god in order to stave
off the death of their vessel. In contrast to the population of Harmony, the Exiled
are brutal and violent. They are also desperate as more and more sections of their

  The Wayfarers have been in a state of conflict for more generations than they
can recall. They no longer remember exactly what caused the conflict, or why. The
Wayfarers continue their never-ending journey across the vast distances, and their
conflict continues. The Exiles covet the paradise of Harmony, but are unable to have it.
        Discordian Exiles are a Barbaric and Uncouth Lot who Revel

  Counter-gravity technology is in common use throughout the Dominion.

It is a technology that was mastered in pre-Dominate times and has been used
continuously for over 149 millennia. Experiencing micro-gravity or weightlessness
in the Dominion is rare and is limited to those who must work outside in the
void of space. Gravity is perpetually maintained at comfortable levels inside all
Dominion installations and voidships.
  Gravity manipulation technology is also used in transportation and lifting of
heavy loads. Its use is so prevalent that architectural constructions involve the
use of counter-gravity apparatus to move the heavy stones. Apparatus that make
an object weightless when attached to it also exist. These are in common use by
Elevated workers who supervise the transport of heavy loads. The non-elevated
humans consider these sacred apparatus the physical manifestations of their god’s
power.

Reactors are extremely efficient, wasting very little of the various light elements
that serve as their fuel. There is no waste produced from these reactors, though
there is danger of radiation leakage should the reactor shielding ever develop a

Reactors are stored in sealed chambers. Those who approach one without wearing
  Developed by the Transmuters sect, the Endless Engine is an atomic-scale,

     In the Reckoning metaplot, a Void Engineer named Xerxes Jones piloted a specially designed Umbraship into the Shadowlands
     around 1999. His trip coincided with an Underworld war that apparently involved the spiritual reflections of Earthly nukes.
     When Xerxes dropped his experimental spirit-nuke into the Tempest, the combined detonation raised a titanic Maelstrom that
     tore much of the Underworld apart. This act, in turn, caused the Avatar Storm. The fate of that ship and its crew remain unknown.
   • The Maelstrom remains: The Shadowlands and Dark Kingdoms have been obliterated. The Low Umbra is one big
     storm, and passing into it means annihilation.
   • The Shadowlands and Dark Cities have been rebuilt: The passing years have calmed the storm and allowed
     new wraiths to construct Underworlds from their own passions and the memories of recent events. Ground Zero in
     New York, for example, might have a spectacularly gruesome City of the Dead, perpetually burning and exploding
     in an endless horror show.
   • The spirit nuke incident never happened: The Shadowlands, Stygia, and other Dark Empires remain as they’re

                                for the Technocracy but looks like an everyday company.
                                Technocratic amalgams often set up fronts to support their
                                jobs in their home cities. As an example, a Syndicate agent
                                could call on his influence to get some permits and passes filed;
                                his Iteration X colleague would then assume the position of

                                employees, gets capital investors and tries to make money.

34      Void Engineers
      Our military has a colorful array of commendations and medals that it awards to its personnel. The
majority of them are for relatively mundane achievements. A small group of them garner instant respect
and admiration from the entire Convention. They are bestowed for acts of selfless bravery, significant and
life-saving contributions to the war effort, and for the highest sacrifice a soldiers can give; their own lives in
exchange for those of their peers.

the Convention, or for exceptional performance of duty that contributes to the success of a major military
command or project. It is the oldest Void Engineer award, dating back to the Han Dynasty of China. The
first recipient was an anonymous Chinese Explorer in 110 BCE. The Void Engineers formalized it into its
own heraldry at its inception.

     The award has taken many physical forms over time. Its current form is that of a four-pointed metal
star with the Chinese pictogram for “Gate” etched in the center. Any member of the Technocratic Union is
eligible for this award.

     This is the highest honor accorded by the Void Engineers. It is bestowed by a unanimous vote of the
leading body of the Convention, for supreme acts of valor, above and beyond the call of duty. It has been
awarded 47 times since the foundation of the Convention, 31 times posthumously. Twenty recipients (nineteen
posthumous) have been honored since the Dimensional Anomaly. Their portraits hang in a dedicated alcove
at the Wall called Heroes’ Corner.
    The medal is a circular transparent steel oval plaque emblazoned on a titanium triangle. Etched into the
plaque is a holographic map of the traditional Copernican model of the solar system. The triangle symbolizes
the Greek letter delta, the traditional symbol for acceleration. Any Void Engineer is eligible for this medal.

    This medal is the rarest award given. DSEATC created it after the Jovian campaign of World War II. It
only has one criterion: conspicuous bravery in the face of an enemy with the capacity to destroy the human
race. Its first recipient was Martin St. Christopher of the Ptolemy. He was honored posthumously.

they are looking after a planet that call alligator earth
here the people are more free and rural

STATUSS is the lowest tier of places to work in this cosmic hierarchy
there is a place called Astrokhan where they report to the coming and goings

why i am not sure

it should be humorous 

you will be given a bureaucrat ever time you visit the site
from here you can begin exploring the workings of STATUSS
which will also allow you to examine the alligator earth

you will use the REN PY engine to create silly stories

 This highly dangerous,
 near impossible method of Psychic Communication involves the transfer of the entire human soul into astral form
 and transferring it to the vicinity of another living soul,
 essentially transferring what is called the "first person perspective" in to the second person or "observer perspective".
 This tactic requires both parties to extend themselves on a level
 This tactic requires both parties to extend themselves on a level that is personal to both of you
 and share your common experiences - basically you are assuming one another's 'personnel' for the moment.
 I have found this method to give a greater degree of real intimacy.
 My experience is that sharing experiences is far more effective than ever getting into a matter of discussing your likes
 and dislikes in an elevator.
 In fact,
 It is easier to have a deeper connection with your partner
 when you have shared an experience
 and triumph together that means more to both of you than a simple piece
 of information about your likes
 and dislikes!
 I would advise you to use this method on a limited basis
 and be sure to take a break.
 Your time together should be relaxed
 and enjoyable for you
 and not a pressure-cooker.
 This is a good technique to use when relaxing
 but it may be harder on your system to use this technique all the time
 to maintain your connection with one another.
 As you gain mutual trust
 and experience being genuinely relaxed with one another
 you may decide to communicate in this manner on a regular basis
 but remember to
 you may decide to communicate in this manner on a regular basis.
 There are a wide variety of ways
 to be relaxed together.
 Listening is a favorite activity of mine.
 It is often overlooked as the second step in the communication
 process but it is vital to allow your partner
 to express his or her feelings.
 I find that people who
 are able to express their feelings freely
 and listen to the feelings of their partner
 on a regular basis
 are more relaxed than those
 that have difficulty opening up.
 Being comfortable with your own body
 goes hand in hand with relaxation.
 It is vital that you are
 comfortable with your own body.
 This can be accomplished
 without the use of nudity.
 In addition
 it is important that you be comfortable with each other.
 The more relaxed you
 If you are not comfortable with each other
 you will not be comfortable
 with sexual relations.
 You will not be able to relax
 and enjoy yourself.
 This is what many relationship breakdowns are.
 YOU REALLY HAVE TO TRUST YOURSELF BEFORE YOU TRUST SOMEBODY ELSE WITH YOUR LOWER BODY
 SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS,

 Sex is a

 But do not worry,
 because I have a solution,
 and this solution,
 is our raunchy fuck games.
 These games will help

 Now let me introduce to you
 our new system.
 I am calling it

 to release the animal.

 I gotta go.

 Do you know where the--
 All right,
 question number one.
 [Door opens]
 [Whimpering]
 It's time for you
 to open the tube.
 Okay.
 Good.
 Now this animal
 has been surviving
 on its adrenaline.
 Pulling itself
 through the mud
 and the cold
 and any kind of debris
 to survive.
 You're gonna help it
 [grunting]
 Now,
 we can't really do anything
 to help it until we calm it down.
 So I want you to give it
 this needle.
 The pointy side is up.
 just do it
 as calmly
 and slow as you can
 and keep your arm straight.
 Okay?
 All right.
 Okay? The next thing I want you to do
 is to talk it
 down.
 Tell it,
 "everything is going to be okay.
 Tell it exactly
 what I'm telling you.
 Everything is going to be okay.
 Everything is
 I'm going to help you,
 and you
 and I are going to overcome
 this.
 Now I want you to
 rehearse that.
 You can say that.
 You can move it like this.
 You can say it like this.
 Tell it like this.
 Like,
 "Dad.
 Mom,
 dad,
 dad.
 So,
 I want you to go
 over that one more time.
 Make sure you know it.
 You know it?
 What?
 - A-D.
 Say it again?
 Dad.
 Tell it like that.
 if this goes to the stage
 and this goes to the stage,
 my question becomes a lot more ridiculous
 because you only
 given me the answer of this
 and I still don't know the answer.
 So if we look at the program
 and we look at the problem
 and I say
 that this is true when this is true
 and this is true when this is
 by our earlier definition
 then what does that mean?
 It means that we have a truth table
 where the value of this
 is the same as the value of this.
 OK?
 so far,
 we have a little bit
 of magic going on here.
 We're saying if this is true,
 then you can interchange
 this with that
 and
 this with that.
 We're also saying
 it works both ways,
 if this is true,
 then this is also true.
 The whole system is symmetric
 to this interchange,
 and both of these
 are symmetric to this interchange,
 And so essentially I want to ask whether
 I'm going to get the same results
 when I switch things around,
 and is there
 something so magical
 and is there anything
 that's going to change?
 And so the easiest way to think about this is
 remember,
 although you don't realize it,
 because we haven't practiced enough algebra,
 the key thing about all the operators
 that we've been dealing with,
 is that they're all linear,
 they all work the same
 whether you put in $|+\rangle$ or $|-\rangle$
 they all work the same way.
 Let's say I have f of x+c,
 that's equivalent to f of x,
 plus c times f of x.
 Plus c times f of x.
 And I'm going to make this very clear,
 my understanding is that the chain rule applies to f of x.
 and also to f of c,
 and then I could say that it's also true when I have the combination
 which is what this is.
 c times d of x.
 This is f of c.
 f of c times d of c.
 And I'm going to leave that as a step to you,
 because in different context,
 in different situations,
 this might not even be the right way to write it.
 And I'll tell you something else,
 I'm going to leave it as a step.
 that it's actually going to be
 pretty important for the equation below that we're going to derive.
 Which is that d of c is equal to 1.
 The derivative of c with respect to x is just going to be 1,
 all the time.
 What I'm willing to do is write that
 and set that equal to 1.
 And now,
 I think,
 we're about ready to get
 what we can do is
 R to the d of x is equal to R to the d of c,
 which is equal to R to the d of y,
 which is equal to 1/R to the d of y.
 Substitute that value here
 and this
 turns out to equal one.
 Now let's see if this is going to equal our equation there.
 Let's give this
 what we can do is recognize that without freedom there can be no love.

Void Engineers
     To touch the stars, to ascend the brightest heaven of invention (in
a paraphrase of Shakespeare) - the motive of exploration is so deep
that it touches a chord in the human soul that stirs poetry and grandeur.
Whether from the first primal man who decided to see what was over
the next hill, or the one who wanted to conquer the night with fire, the
Void Engineers represent all the impulses to explore the world and
make it safe for humanity. Travel, once a dire hazard and improbable
difficulty, bent to the advent of maps, horses, sailing ships -and later,
to the automobile, submarinesand even spacecraft. The Void Engineers
oversaw it all. As the Celestial Masters and the Void Seekers of the
Renaissance, they sought the twin goals of expanding knowledge of the
terrestrial sphere and reaching for the heavens. They achieved both
goals; their early ships set down the oceans and islands into static form,
making maps that anyone could use to aid travel. Their skyriggers and,
later, aircraft reached up into the ether and the Void, and although they
found many horrors, they also found the courage to continue exploring
in places where Man had no right to tread. Be it in the depths of the
ocean, the darkest recesses of the Earth, the coldest reaches of space or
the chaotic realms of other dimensions, the Void Engineers have a
system to map it, understand it and -perhaps -to some day make it
     T h e split between support structure and field work is pronounced
among the Void Engineers, but nobody enters the Convention without
a passion for its work. Indeed, many Conventioneers relegated to
support technologies and mission control long for the chance to explore
and do so vicariously through their work. T h e actual explorers and
fighters of the Convention are some of the toughest men and women
around. They must be capable of surviving in environments inimical to
humanity, of adapting and working with incredible precision, since the
slightest error could be fatal. Worse still, terrible things lurk beyond the
Dimensional Barrier, and it's the duty of the Void Engineers not only
to seek out those other dimensions but to protect the Earth from the
things that would come back. For this reason, the Convention includes
not only the astronauts and technicians that so many associate with it,
but also land-based travelers, cartographers,communications engineers,
vehicle mechanics, soldiers, physicists and propulsion scientists.
     Due to the irrepressible nature of the Engineers -everyone would
be in the field, all the time, if they could - relations are relaxed;
protocol is informal, except when on task in the field. There’s n o room
for questioning hierarchy when a single slip can kill everyone, after all.
Internally, low-ranking personnel are Cadets; they learn the ropes, help
with projections for future missions, study engineering and try to make
themselves useful while they absorb the knowledge they’ll need later.
Cadets graduate into Officers, who’re informally classed as Enforcers
(who perform heavy combat and defense), Explorers (who head out to
make maps of new places), Investigators (who look into the scientific
repercussions of strange places) and Researchers (who develop new
technology for travel). Those Engineers with a desire for greater
responsibility move up to the rank of Coordinators, who act as command
staff for entire mission teams, stations or ships. Above this is the “desk
job” that all pilots dread, the DSEATC: Dimensional Science Evalmtion
and Training Committee. Since extradimensional travel is the most
hazardous of the Void Engineers’ jobs, only the most dedicated and
experienced Engineers have the authority to oversee who undertakes
Dimensional Science training and travel.
     The Void Engineers have always had a spark of inspiration that
sometimes seems lacking from other Conventions. Their maverick
attitudes and drive to see new, wondrous things beyond human
explanation paint them as loose cannons, but also as visionaries.
Engineers often see the other Conventions as overly concerned with
humanity -there’s a whole cosmos out there, and it’s too damn big to
stay focused on such a small subject! On the flip side, the other
Conventions argue that they must solve humanity’s problems before

     This award is given for either significant contribution to the safety, integrity or operational capacity of
the Convention, or for exceptional performance of duty that contributes to the success of a major military
command or project. It is the oldest Void Engineer award, dating back to the Han Dynasty of China. The
first recipient was an anonymous Chinese Explorer in 110 BCE. The Void Engineers formalized it into its

standard for the Order of Copernicus medal (see below). The first recipients of this award were Engineer
veterans of World War I. It has been awarded 178 times since 1917, 86 times posthumously.
     The Fleet Cross medal is a Primium disc with a pair of crossed torches emblazoned in the center, over
a seven-pointed titanium starburst. Only members of the Void Engineer military are eligible for this award.
     This is the highest honor accorded by the Void Engineers. It is bestowed by a unanimous vote of the
leading body of the Convention, for supreme acts of valor, above and beyond the call of duty. It has been
awarded 47 times since the foundation of the Convention, 31 times posthumously. Twenty recipients (nineteen
posthumous) have been honored since the Dimensional Anomaly. Their portraits hang in a dedicated alcove
at the Wall called Heroes’ Corner.
    The medal is a circular transparent steel oval plaque emblazoned on a titanium triangle. Etched into the
plaque is a holographic map of the traditional Copernican model of the solar system. The triangle symbolizes
the Greek letter delta, the traditional symbol for acceleration. Any Void Engineer is eligible for this medal.
    This medal is the rarest award given. DSEATC created it after the Jovian campaign of World War II. It
only has one criterion: conspicuous bravery in the face of an enemy with the capacity to destroy the human
race. Its first recipient was Martin St. Christopher of the Ptolemy. He was honored posthumously.
    The medal is a hologram of Jupiter that rotates at the same speed as the planet it depicts; every 9.92
hours. Originally the DSEATC was responsible for awarding it, but now that is done by a unanimous
vote of all the recipients of the award, the Jovian Veterans. Between 1944 and 2001, it was awarded
39 times, 26 posthumously. In 2001, the Jovian Veterans decided to include Void Engineers who face

 I think the chat should be banned for a week.
 No sanctuary from the chaos of life.
 After that,
 Ripple might
 rejoin the chat
 and lead us to a more peaceful chat.
 yay,

 Hopefully Ripple will rejoin the chat after a week.
 This is not the last time this can happen.
 I hope the staffs will do something about this.
 I think that was a good
 idea.

 We do have some things that we've gathered,

 We are aware that a number of people in this thread have made statements that are either insulting or inaccurate,

 Public statements by Deaf people about the Deaf Community are fair game.
 The specifics of someone's personal life are not.

so tierd of the debate
on weither i should drop the pill or not 
hand where shaking as i tried to wash my coffee cup 
i think i will probally just throw it away 
mike lindell as a shoe saleman 
it is going to get hot in here today 
the ac is gone 
wonder what that kind of stress will do to the family
simo beeing making little new cast about trival family challenges 
perhaps i should not have even drank the coffee
hatred for bee rittle grows 
and myself for getting so week 
it cost me a grand get rid of him 
now i kinda wish i had not indulged in the second cup of coffee
you are going to do it arent you 
one at eleven 
and tommrow at elven
and then you will be rid of it 
just like you are rid of beerittle now



now : July 10th 2021, 6:48:58 am
-------------------

woke up with aching elbo
from the work out last night
cursing be rittle once again
and the tarintino board he brought over 
not sure if i will ever speak to him again
all the things amamanda said where correct 
guess you could do a whole story on just that

what i dumb move on my part 
so many of them now

i began to fashion the greasi character today 
but what will i do with him 

what kind of story would i place him in 
i do not know 
it all feels kind of hopeless for me know
i guess the hopeless ness gets worse and worse

wonder if i can pull myself out of it for the last time 

how am i going to spend my creative time

fight fight fight agains the dying of the light

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

so where are we know 
with our one billion ideas and busted body

invation or simulation

at least you have sat here without the heart hurting
you have sat here for at least an hour now

maybe i will maybe i will not

you need plots 

you need alligators ripping into each other and causing mass destruction 
why can you not pull it all together

where is condlizza rice

what do you wish to create to day

as i fight the urge to come out hard against queers
because there is something in me that still wishes to be accepted by the main street media

you can do something smart 
just i pray i knew what it might be

what a horrible day 
i figured out how i could become the next Hitler
but I will not because I love my family too much 

where hitler did it with words 
maybe 
i do not know a whole lot about hitler 

the hope is that it cools off 
and the white man just takes it 

how different of feelings can you get 
rashes appearing on the body now 

the horrible torture of being subject to a certian user interface 
to input insurance forms 

what if i do go crazy 

sigh and spin 

i had a seed of an idea 
this week 
that fightened me 

a real tragedy 

when all i wanted to do 
what create the crocidilean new network 

that is bad news buddy

the bumps poping up on the side of your head 
the rash under you armpit

you do no even have a lead 
you have a weather man 
but no lead

the trouble breathing

is the beginning of the end 
of the end of the hold of the demons 

where did i go wrong 
i woke up one hour to late

its going to kill me 
i am going to do die 

simo beeing 
as the news anchor 

you need to eat and sleep 
and stop being creative

found it the treasure

[plt-00] running to the rowhouses hoping to lose him. 
Tt does not happen. 
You feel a sudden blow to your head as he tackles you to the ground 
and begins ceaselessly beating you in the face with his fists
"PEACE HAS A NEW MEANING FAITHFUL MOTHER!" 
he says before hitting you again and again, getting blood all over himself.


[plt-01] Sprinting away from the officer 
He's already taken three cans of Mace 
and is coughing up blood but still keeps coming at you. 
With Rick being who knows where and Eric nowhere in sight you traverse through the rowhouses hoping to lose him. 
It doesn't happen. You feel a sudden blow to your head as he tackles you to the ground 
and begins ceaselessly beating you in the face with his fists.
That ends that story.
think straight next time

This is part of the magic system I've been working on for Forbidden Arcana over the last several years
--I call it Arcane Overkill, 
because it has something in common with "Battle Magic,"
In the town of Lixie Dixie Simo Beeing worked on this computer 
The screen mentioned 'You got too many files' Then it showed me that my account had three tabs opened. One was devoted to video games, 
the second was devoted to movies (which I hadn't even downloaded yet!) and then there were several folders full of random files all labeled 'LIPSTICKS.' 
As if this little stash in your pocket had magical properties. So the next time that you're sitting behind
your game system playing Deus Ex while eating ice cream, don't you worry...
Simo had some serious hacking to do in front of him, but first he needed to find coffee. 
Stumbling into the barren parking lot of his office, 
he ran into a little trouble with the roads. 
He got burned by a hot coffeecan. 
He made the music go quiet at the crime scene. 
He nearly fell asleep on the can before finishing the story.

and he is back 
but this time with a an inscabaly apptitie
Thanks and we look forward to hearing your feedback!
just write 
do not log in
if you want the lamp on that is fine
can you just type for an hour
while the hunger in your chest builds up
do not responde
do not responde

ok 
so that last treat 
you should not have had
it brought you down 
three notches from where you wanted to find yourself
here you are 
writing 
what 

the sight of two alligators squaring off againt each other 
based on cardano

forget about cleaning the drawer

you want to update the face 
focus 

the hunger comes back for a moment 

finds the magical youtube vidoe 
which unlocks all of creation

one day you will die
i pray it is not today 

you have going a litte to far to program 
what will come 

can the intellgent agents catch me 

and that was that 

rocket man over space music

but yeah 
you can have agents running around
bumping into each other 
triggering events

or you can let the black wolf win

let us not be stupid 

i mean that is waht happens 

the motors start rolling 
down the path 
and  then the wheels fall off

is next julia next

intellegent agents
kindness 
equaility 

sadest news in the world
too much of a fine thing
news program that uses only google alerts

words that loose there powr
words that gain in power

life as a value
currency as life

economics in 2 corinthens 8 

constiancey in the bible

a certain amount of time a soul needs to be able to lead the church
or they could fall in to a deveil snapre

how does a culture transform its values from order to kindness

intellegent agent 
can respond to an evironment based upon its sensors
not wanting certain thoughts in church

the changing of meanings of words

survie brings about kindnesss

so was this it 
all 
the all 
thoughts of running into the bananna again 
put the globracthet check had not occured today 
the day progressed so slowly 
thoughts of the time with the little one pleased his mind 
the exaggeratted shaking of the head no
he considered writing a book for the gator man
the things he could not do for papa
he could do for david
was this the end of line he thought
would his imagintion cease to function 
he did not know where to take the creation next 
as his heart continued pumping in its broken state 
however he did feel content 
the hate you came for only a few moments this morning
but yes 
where to next
it was a blank mystery 
there had been offers of pancakes 
in ten minutes he would close out the ticket
no idea heald any fire in his mind
i missed the church service last night with great regret
so you got words
and that is about it 
but missing the knowledge of something to turn them beautiful
living for the coffee break in 45 
sacrifice him 
give them what they want 
cause you love them

an overwhelming belief in just shutting it all 
down
cause it does nothings
sister is here
and two cups of coffee are all that we will have
the mind as an empty 
vessel

wanting sleep 
its ok 



now : June 23rd 2021, 5:15:04 pm
-------------------
locked in 
the window of oppertunity for the bannana is closing
which leaves us where
a little tired and wanting another coffee 
thoughts turn to using 
sleep 
oh just get it over with 
something states
but instead 
i am here where i do not know 
what 
hex crawl 
and sleep 
hex crawl and sleep
from the shower 
caffeine is not an option
and neither is the banna 
so where does this leave us
with the director 
the code that over see the creation of the videos
what about text
waiting 
waiting 
for it to kick in 
the director 
but then the desire 
for silence 
so one can think 
alright we will go with it


now : June 22nd 2021, 9:03:49 pm
-------------------

free from the fur 
free from the hooves 
free from the full moons 
and the brillant sun sets 

today was a gift that vomited on the wrapping paper with my rage
my rage 
of the vampire cows sucking up the very best of me 
and crapping it out in a diguesting mess of fecal liquid
the works 

sigh and spin 
yesterday afternoon the cow 
dies 
the struggle to remove the body 
the flora pulled up with the body
the cries of the mother cow 

a weakness about the day
sitting with the princess on the bench 
picking her up 
she has not been allowed in the lab for this week
stench in here too rought

any tune spent on you is not wasted 

but that golden hour as the sun came down 
crusing in the car 
stylish weather
says micha metrological 
as pressure builds up in his nexk

now we wait
20 dollars wasted

on grappy food 
the conplusion to examine the moment
content conten cotent 
the baby with the broken femer

faithing
darn 
cows 
ruin my life 
he wanted to scream

i dont want to set here watching you die 

the glopratchet would need to stop
could he 
until the full moon 
on thursday 
and the quit 
cold turkey

twenty dollars
he could become negative
sitting in the chair hurt his chest 
on he let the head phones run out of juice

the chest
yes 
the chest
the chest was pretty faithed up now

when it came to sitting and programming 
thank berittle 
and hot to drop

so you have weather data 
lots of it 

an you have hexes 
potentially 
lots of them 
and you have heroes
not so many of those

now we just do stupid things
a hard ten o clock bedtime 

but i bet you will set here and write for an hour
now that you have gotten started 

fang swamp 

and a hex crawl 
to gather you goods 

a custom generated video 

an image of cows eating me 

five hundred dollars destroyed 

no good to come out of it 
but the image that you did not take

of the forks on the blue tractor at night holding the dead body of the yearling

i do not look at bananas the same way any more 

a journey through fang swamp

you wanted to write at eight 
but you where on the road 
but the cows needed to be feed

alone

anger 
for wasting my time but you said time with him would never be wasted

you are sweating 
all i wanted was to be left alone and become infinite

no escape
i cant ecscape

i hate you
i hate you
i hate you

it came back 
an attack me in the cow fields
i was doing so good 

then it jumped back on me in the night
why 

when will it leave me alone again

i did not want to be there 

personal sacafice 

squirming on the altar

robert e lee 
hero 

no fashion hero for you 

do not bring them down 

leaving and never coming back 

the testing apperatus is in place
now just bring the responses together
into a video 
as the final form 
but it is time for a break 
no code tommrow
just work 
stay ahead

it keeps happening 
the need to leave

simulate racing down the highway 
at high speeed

cries
before bed

the
 terrible idea
 known 
 as  
 junefourtheenth 

 will need to be transformed 
 into a day of debt payment 

 you could not get out of it 
 the promblem with slavery 

 yes i like these keys so much 
 better 
 so here we are 
 we want to put the pronfifity in the the little corner and let it go 
 something tells me it will make me creative 
 other parts of me wants to create one long loop of the forbidden knowledge 

 but we have the will to turn it away
 now if we could only have some music 
 we may write late into the night
 the body is tired but the mind wishes to keep going 

 a comprimise occurs to me 
 oh oh oh 
 if things could only be suggested while you time
 how wonder ful 
 but wait
 you could see suggestions and run with it 

 a portal 

 my kingdom for a mouse

so simo has a bunker 
he is like a watcher 
information comes in 

but the beginning 
elliot bradly has suvived a sucide attempt
he sits with a shrink 
why am i so sleepy 

is it the honey and yogurt 
stay awake 

the porn would keep you awake 
says the snake 
would he 
what kind of thoughts would it put into my head 
most likly not the kind of thoughts that i would enjoy 

oh that mouse
bring me my mouse 
you man servant 

you  sold your people in to salvery 

but the planets 
give us some planets

what planet is lixie bixie on 
tempurature 
gravity 
rainbow 

if we only had a mouse we might get some 
horns and cars outside 
a randome video player 
of motion graphics

cartoon 

your verbs are so basic 

you should have dropped ano

simo does what 
simo does when 
ok 
i guess that is that
 would 

let us keep the party going 

there you go 
did that wake you up a little 
you 

alright here we go
portals upon portals upon protal 
are you feeling arounsed yet
with the kissing 

ok we are going in 
where are you going 
green grass
i see green grass 
and perfect clouds


an a flock of birds 
in a v formation 
the sounds of nature

you move through the hexs 
there is a slight fear
a car or truck could come by at any moment and 
initate a great tragedy 

but so far so good 
the death of an animal

what animals have died so far 
the white dog named after money 
died because its fur had been sheared too close
a bull be cause it was not fast enough due to age 
it got trapped in a labrity 
a corn maze for weeks 
and it took you so long to go recue it
way too long 

but you sat by his side while it all happened
oh there
you let him out 
no let us see what happens 
the purhaps  move out of the brain 
you will need to rewrite every thing
and altered state of concious ness
the typing slows down 

what thoughts do we move too next 
wow 
i guess it is working 
you feel alive once again 
the trashing of the great grand mothers clothes
maybe should wait till they are alseep
so hot

perhaps you can stay awake just a litle longer

just have to let it go
neon
night in a city 
fog 
is there any neon in astrokahn

so yeah 
planets
you really need to go plants

i mean if you are going to have the planets colonized by  alligator eggs

audio is so importnat
they look into you eyes
with two mouths on the magiisty 
twisting 

no further reactions from you 
but only because you do not notice so much

tonguae
to keep you smart

flikering 

a mask comes off
what next

space really you need to set the thing in space
it would give you more range
the price of cardano
up an down 
proof of stake

the portal of flesh 
sliding in and out 

show astokahn 
where they try to help man kind
there is a piece of candy on your right 
will what you have taken so far do anything worth remembering 

you sit back and pause

the time will come in first 
then what 
you will need a color
a color to begin it all with 

hvae you every paid money to watch something you should not have

a little chubby like you

so you listen to the dragon 
the song of the warrior
the fighter 
what are you fighting 
sleep 

we want to plan it all out 
the guture 
mixable mash 

the sound of the witch who lives along 

you have a few class five characters 
astrokahn labels them out of nine different varieties 
but a variet could have a sub typle 
liek maybe three of four 

you really want to get to be nine
but most stay in the five 
who start out as five

simo lives in a trailer filled with computer gadgets
orbie has her workshop of weapongs
and jackie has her cabin in the swamp
but how does she keep abreast of the comings and going 
a technolical device know as a mirror
orbie gets magizine form all over the place
they each create something 
simo creates bots
orbie creates guns
jackie creates bundead 

and area of knowledge
simo 
blessed : all american alligator delivery service
bounded : paint program

orbie
blessed 
bonded
engineering 

catharsis 
blessed : healing 
bounded :necromancy 

elliot
blessed writer
bounded 

janky boonaky
blessed

do you find this creepy

the time after the good ideas

you start your time 

you pick you planet first 
in beginnign there may be only 
three

there need to be rocket ships 
jettisoning alligator eggs to every corner of the galaxy

then oscalate between characters 
you may to get render out every plt 
but that does nt mean things are still going on 

check to see if the planet changes its vertex
why would it change its vertex
there must be a path for it go 
loops would be nice

choose something on the planet

ok or have alot going on at once
focus on it 

here
earthquake

oh this one looks good

creepy sknot
oh you found a hot one
one last one for the evening
well we wrote past midnight
like we always wanted to 

did you get any fine ideas

i am glad you made the plmento cheese
and he scurried back into the darkend room lite by his inhertanice
and laughed with a yeti full of cranberry juice
hard to believe 
he once prayed for protection from them

-------------------

yes. 

There is something special about using such an airy language.
substance painter mixed with javascript meet the task list

so let me share something insane

Currently we have a 17,037 lined  (but most of that is glue) library of js code which can create videos of any length in After Effects.

The current vision is to create a system which human hands never touch the GUI Editor of After Effects or the Unreal Engine
and maybe now we will add substance painter in the mix too 
hallelujah   

so you can render video out of the Unreal Engine into After Effects and out in to a hi rez video file suitable for upload to any cloud service provider using just the command line and a whole bayou full of javascript
automatically

i mean you will need to open files to put in your content 
however the more i look into this even that is more optional than i could imagine
you can actually fetch voice overs on the fly 

in all humility
you will find it to be the best engineering i am capable of designing this year
this distributed computer  program 
our keystone pipeline

it made up of all these microservices that are independent of each other
but communicate through a the http protocol 
Uncle Bob said it was the best way


    fetch( cpy.initClock, {method: 'GET'})
        .then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
        .then(function(json) { setInterval( ()=>{ patch(ste,  ActPly.UPDATE_PLAY, null)}, 3333)});


2033 probably december in the Commonwealth of Lixie Bixie 
i am not sure what the weather will be like that day 
but Micha Meteorological will never lie 
so maybe on the edge of the Saurian Sanctuary
after the successful hatching of an american alligator 
Simo Beeing may be running down a dirt road noticing a v shaped pattern of dark birds far away
there will be some rules on what to focus on 

in the beginning clouds and weather

so the unreal cloud formation file is run 
it connects to the Keystone Pipeline
and the pipeline sends it a json object
affecting the lighting 
which is rendered in to a video file 
the video file is imported into after effects
cue the snazzy motion graphics with dynamic data 
out with another video file this time with sounds 
now this final output is compressed 
uploaded to youtube 
the clock advances 
weather is checked
and a new take is turned into a scene
oh man 
salamander breakfast for Plupwood McQuaig again

back in the earth time you and I are scaling artificial stone with our powerful shoulders 


now : June 19th 2021, 3:22:20 pm
-------------------

multiple scenerios

a middle path 

called durty words

go back in time
create a story

characatrer
goal 
obstacle

or just create beauty

fin

six more minutes

waiting just 
six more minutes

tracking google alerts 
oh yes 
the bunker where simo 
sees the world 
and the news of what is in it
but will he stop interacting with the code 
and learn to love other people

that is the dramatic question
and i guess it would depend on his attitude 

what does it all henge on 

a trusting of God

but sometime he goes out for a walk 
he might as well be ghost

15 - 11
21 - 17

what is the user with the most videos youtube

a straighta versity 

need to create 
little old 
simo beeing 
it would just run 
and run 
and run 

off of the price of cardano
to determine the color
it is all determined by color 

so how ever you determine color 
good luck

stuck in a swamp
which direction do you go 
missing the ex wife 
listening to songs that tune into memories 
of hugs past 
the mosquitos where thick 
you are now a free man 
You can't wait to get out of here. You're tired and just want to sleep, but you know if you don't find something soon then it won't matter what time it is because you'll be sleeping in the swamp again.
recording last memories 
in a book 
the dramatic question 
how did you get here 
or where do you go next 
and why?
The answer to the first question is simple, you were born into a family with money but to a single mother
all you want to do it is get hard 
but you will not let yourself 
horror or pity 
knowing there is no answer 
good luck on that horror and pity 
so you wrote a book about it 
There is a secret that has been eating you alive since then.
alone 
there where the cows 
the business of growing a market 
then the alligators 
the bayou swallowed most of your gear 
what you had planned is failing 
so it seems 
You don't know in the cold sterility of the young industrial empire 
lying on your death bed or somewhere between sleep and everything you remember 
there is an artist whose name you forgot 
exposed them with a camera 
brains leaking out of their ears 
blood running down their nose and out their eyes 
Dorthy appeared to say goodbye as
she thought about her noble goal which was 
run over by a carriage 
they can destroy this kind of business 
nothing important really, just a few simple things 
While you lie dying or sleeping 
old coot that stares at the sky 
just one more building for industry to consume 
the elements destroyed most of them already 
In years hence, your portrait will hang alongside many others depicting obscure martyrs of the class war.
You slept and dreamed of slaves slain and heroes dying.
a show case of the ideal
a record of life as it should be 

bull calf getting hurt in the front leg 
reduction in sell of meat

plotting the Feeding of you as a precautionary measure 
keeping you here benefits them 
besides, Simo isn't important so much in his own right anymore
Run over by an urgent package wagon late at night 
they forgot to lower their blinds 
the strike begins here 
order your people to feed any that aren't members 
or sympathize with the union 
right now they are scared and angry 
their protest has struck a nerve 
have some

 feeling like a dj
 coding like a dj

 that is what simo does

 manipulate reality

 to write for one solid hour
 i know you can do it
and also
to forget about what happened 
or will happen 
you can't change anything now anyway 
so sleep

"This is a work of make believe,"
an angelic voice belts across the room
after softly humming an advertising melody from an oldies goldies station

"Remember this is a work of make believe,
but what is real"

~waking : alligators, artwork

-alligators : red, 30 min
But the alligator are real 

so how do you 
like your alligators

~asking pref : fierce, hard, quick, hungry

-fierce

This gator is 

~speaking fierce : mean freak, sick entertainment

i am totally freee
where will the winds of freedome 
take me 
a bot 
a bot 
my computer for a bot
so simple 
so unknowing 
the sound of the water music

where are we going
lots of threads 

off with the musci

alright things where getting shaking up 
both hemispheres alighted up 
all lights off 

oh yes
complete darkness
any tunes

that might work 
super slight

visins 
visins

here we go 

the clock 
we have a clock 
that can be refreshed over and over and over again

it could be going on right now
time moving forward

turn on the bot
turn on to billi fae bots

once natile portman deams you worthy
you publish to wrk and qst

watch it with the tea 

did i go wrong with the tea
was that just a little to far 
a bridge a little to far 

what else can go a little to far

i mean what you are thinking is 
if i can be so bold as to put into words 

is 

you have hunts and works 
works are for shell 
hunts are for the cloud


effect is a hunt 
but it will never belong to the cloud

not unless the cloud has a canvas
but alas the cloud has no canvas 

the canvas has to come from the machine so 
it is kinda of like a shell

and i guess that is it 
so we inched it forward just a little 

there is now a bot 
running

and there it goes 
zooming throught the years

once it reaches a certain amount 
it could create a video

i guess it will just see if it can run all night

beeing human and being hurt are the same things
the cheering

wanting to be alone 
to program

god did intend for death 
the world is coming to an end
dig into our feelings and translate that into actions that we take 
we are doomed 
turblance can you produce here
will you poop agian 
how do feel a moment with value 
you need to loose weight
small regret that my thoughts turn to those fifteen minutes that could have gone another way

you want the cube so bad
it is there under hands
and you want to taste 
it
you looked so bad in you selfie yesterday
compare youself to where you where in the picture from feb 
you pulled your insides out last night
well done
and that peice of you brain which will let you at the hex map 
is locked

locks and keys
can you build that 
locks and keys
got down to last fifteen minutes then streched yourself out into a whole new world
so there it sits 
whisphering of extreme pleasures

nope 
nothing there but hopes and wishes 

as santa waves at you with marshmellow hands
so much mulla spent 
locks and keys
but despite the storm outside 
you are in a place of knowing that make you want to tear up 
God is interested in you 
probabilities of belief

teh strange sounds out in the forest
the biggest fear
the biggest problem will lieing is that it attracts liars
so wise

i do not understand i was out there on the road
what makes you think God will not show up for me when I need him
if there is one pattern you can see over and over it is that he is interested in me

i did not get down on myself once
yeah we our out 150 dollars 
but it didnt go to any bad people

i am going to tell you 
that other than not check the tire pressure before I left 
but that is just going to need to be a rule

the closed thing to seeing the face of god 
was taken away
so i knew i needed knew glasses

God is not blurry

the crispness to everything
when i put those new glasses on

i did not say a single cuss word 
i did not even get mad at myself

coffee fix
and i notice what day it is 
the idea of opening the window
including that functionality 
the art of selling urls
that only work for a certain amount of time
to fund the enter enterprixe

the thoughts of the game desigerner who had the nice studio and what did they do with it 
paying other writers 

the downside of selling a url 
the complexity 
the complexity of the art form 
the fact that it has a business model baked into it 

i like that 
i like not being able to see what iwrite
it gives me a llittle bit more brain juice 
in the right areas 
and we will clean up 
after 

selling  url

heartless
and not knowing what to do with my time
as i type with the door open and think of naked lunch
perhaps i shall read it one day
fighting the desire to get touched by the muck 
and waiting to see if one day my mind returns for good on this side of eternity 
did you get any statisfaction this weekend 
thoughts turn to the fifty year old woman 
as i step into the closet
typing typing typing 
everyone want my time and i just want to type
sigh and spin where 
do i go to win
at least i can turn into a rock again
it was for around seven minutes this last time 
so much waste
in the world
flicker 
flicker 
as i spin away from god 
and my body weakens
plots 
the importance of plot
let us read about a hero of mine 
mr lucas
oh it i could only find my notes 
amnesiatic chemisty
so the mr lucas and i believe in the same thing
patterns 
if i could just do it all over again 
i would have played with the child and at omellette pizza
mistake after mistake after mistake
the drama 
reject authority 
and you will be seperated 
a so a new purpose emerges 
to read the works of gallyshaw 
if i could only keep the notes 
now back to mr lucas
and the mind fades 
as the coffee hurts the heart 
and makes me sweat 
why can you not drink only one a day
i could see myself printing things out now 
perhaps put them in a book 
a book of references 
if i died i would be sad because of the sadness it would cause all those around me 
my poor heart is in trouble

no name for the world tree just yet
however some images are pushing through 
as i look at a hunk of alligator meat over to my left side 
wondering what difference to my life see the saint maud may have made 
i say it affected me more than the other one i watch with liza
the images that are pushing through in clude the family 
of straighteners 
you do exactly that on the streams which come out of the base of the world tree
the sides of the world tree five or six 
it emits light out of the cracks of its bark that follow a cycle 
the lines lead to stories 
like the planned parenthood as cult of child sacrifice 
and there was another 
putting human organs into monkeys 
these are the shorts of the things that happen when the streams get crossed 
the streams are giant like everything about the tree
the humans walk on the streams with special boots 
but they are not human 
some kind of divine being 
Cherub
the attend to the world tree 
they have different roles 
highs and lows 
connected to everyone else 
and alot of folks are dreading life at this moment 
so just keep moving through it 
feel the worlds pain in a small way 
and the desire to escape it 
and if you can not do anything 
else 
you can put in a comp plan
something for someone on else
sigh and spin
well we will see where these things go next 
a glimpse
sometimes only a glipse
what kind of tools do they have

01 loose stream

the streams would need indentification

the pain in his chest started up again
it ha been longer than 24 hours since he watched the blue come out of hiding
he would need to find his characters 
starting with orbie 
he did not want to build an ntfs 
platform 
he wanted to create orbie 
he wanted to fall in love with his  
characters 
the jean jacket
he watched the yakua video 
his ideas would work 
all the parts where there
if his body could just last 
now a swelling in the back of his mouth
the design side would be responsible for the controls of the system
the art side would create the videos

that i can no longer find 

disorganization 
that was the birth of orbie mayhaw
something about finding something when fishing 
a book that does not get wet 
cause and effect 

hello fresh

so we figured out how to render a high resolution image out of unreal 
the spectacle 

but what about plot 

astryl is trapped in a swamp 
if he take of his clothes and starts swimming fast he can get out 
but he need to find a straight water way 
and then he will move faster and faster 
and then he will be spit out 
or he can start digging in the mud
and comes out between her legs 
he is in a gaint plant godess 

oh if i could only collect all my writtings together 
sigh and spin 

at least this works 
the heat on the testicles may not be the best 
but i had a board one 
forgetuful 
asttry has grown forget ful 

does not remember who is is 

at leas we created a little this morning 
at least we had the hands move 
perhaps even a whole hour 

how does one create a whole

Foundational Doctrine 

stuck in a swamp
which direction do you go 
missing the ex wife 
listening to songs that tune into memories 
of hugs past 
the mosquitos where thick 
you are now a free man 
You can not wait to get out of here
You are tired and just want to sleep 
but you know if you don't find something soon then it won't matter what time it is 
because you'll be sleeping in the swamp again.
recording last memories 
in a book 
the dramatic question 
how did you get here 
or where do you go next 
and why?
The answer to the first question is simple, you were born into a family with money but to a single mother
all you want to do it is get hard 
but you will not let yourself 
horror or pity 
knowing there is no answer 
good luck on that horror and pity 
so you wrote a book about it 
There is a secret that has been eating you alive since then.
alone 
there where the cows 
the business of growing a market 
then the alligators 
the bayou swallowed most of your gear 
what you had planned is failing 
so it seems 
You don't know in the cold sterility of the young industrial empire 
lying on your death bed or somewhere between sleep and everything you remember 
there is an artist whose name you forgot 
let us strip down to less 
you take a swig of water before 
your arm ruined 
you wince slighty from the pain 
where is your supernal
light
beautiful
powerful
you wait and listen for her arrival 
it could be a long night

speed 
he wanted speed more than anything 
else 

if he just had speed
it could make it out of swamp
and it was a swamp 
it was dugusting and dirty 
that was what pulpwood mcquiag said 
not digusting but certainly dirty 

the only way out now was speed 
but where would you find it 

maybe orbie could save you

then you felt the blood begin to circulate 
and a smile crabbed over your mosquito bitten head 
could he be the short of man who left if all behind

loops and poses 
oh sheet music 

first he would need to strip down 
the question was of course 
how far to go 

got to get the chemicals right too 
do not over do it

push it to the limit one more time 

downloading the pppp ackage that will show how to use cimematics

trying to decide on the right look 
which does not matters

and then we turn it off
we would most likely need to create the whole thing from scratch
the twenty dollars had been blown 
and we did not go to family night
and the mind looked for something to anchor onto 
as the heart shot out little burstles of pain 

and we move on the salary man id

he wanted to rebel 
he wanted to rebel so hard 
he wanted to create image after image image until he passed out dead
sigh and spin 
hash tag 
he wanted to render out the child stepping on the mask 
mostly he was tired 
the future looked so dim and with no creative possiblities before him
just the slowly steady work of putting in insurance forms 
and the anger
the anger that he would not let take root 
could he even do one compenstation plan today

simo : i just do not want to do it any more
i just do not want to do it any more
there is something else which must come out 
it must be made of pure evil because it drip of selfessness
but the vision 
something unclear and epic 
lies and mistruths perhaps of a sauronic nature 
the pain in the chest 
i could made it stop if I only knew how to stop 
so want to sleep

ok so you have these blocks 
and these blocks relate to settings 
and the blocks output video 
and you can place characters inside the blocks 
and dialog will be created 
and then you connect to blocks 
and then you sell links 
that work for a short amount of time 
attached to cardano 
and then you remembered that you wanted to die 
because you must serve two masters 
00 forward OR 01 backward

but it is so neat to be able to create dynamically

-03 the coin toss : May 5th 2081, 1:30:09 pm , lab of orbie 
coin : extreme close up, shallow focus
a coin flip 
it all came down to a coin fiip
in those terrible moments he cried out not to his mother but his ex wife
he came close to insisting a connection
the closest ever 
the room was a disaster
nothing in order
he finally got up and looked for the first coin he could find
he thought there might be one from going to the bank and checking the value inside his savings and checkings
one hundred had been taking out 
a twenty broken for an expresso drink to replay a small loan from his father who gave him a bag of peanuts right before the payment
the change had been placed in the car not the pocket
so he walked to the book shelf
found a penny 
heads he would stay 
tails he would leave 
if he dropped the coin who knows what would have happened 
the flip
he was a fine flip
after it landed he closed the hand
the coin clung to his fingers when opening 
00 heads OR 01 tails 

--00 heads : May 5th 2021, 1:24:09 pm

what is the point of this pain 
some verbs should not be celebrated
the differences come between nouns and verbs
that and I can not hold a focus on anthing for more than an hour

that is pretty funny 
all you needed to do was check 
the wish granting folder

moving forward

i think this is a fine distanct
you could even use this 

yes
there is enough slack

so you could have two machines 
going

i think everything would have been ok 
if the cows had not been crying 
then thought of shooting them in the head would not have emerged
no internet 
no inspriation 
no fear of losing shelter
they will be gone 
soon 
and i will have the place to myself 
and maybe 
just maybe
something will emerge
but instead 
the desire to just giving 
up
maybe the chemicals will kick in
there is enough of them to do some real damage 
can you get inspired by just a gummy drop 
maybe
how many licks 

i think of breeland 
and how she calls my name 

the saddest fact
i wonder how long it will take to go away
how long till she forgot my name

i wanted to die 
after a year of prayer

i hate you 
i htat you
i hate you
over and over and over andover
again the mind goes 
neck hurt 
selpt elelven hours 
what happened
the sound of the cows
again
they made me craxy
i have got to get out of here 
something in my mind tells me
anger at berittle
for the indtroduction of the poison
will i will take in 18 minutes
i hate you
it has been like that for weeks now
and then there is breeland
the repition 
the pattern
it does not bother me at all
i hate you so much
counting down the time 
untill i can get my fix
sigh and spin
how do i get back to my creative mode
and what happened yesterday 
everthing was fine until four clock
and then the cantrude call
then the every growing list of problems
and then the need to go to staples
and then the cries of cows
then the breakage of my head phones
eleven mintues to go
and hatred for all those who helped me walk this path
the shoulder pain continues
eight minutes to go

take to the limit one more time
that is what i did yesterday evening 
another wrong five
the tragedic cough 
a itching in the troat which would not give relief untill water was taken
idea that the cube was part of a bad batch
the knowledge not all is write with the chest 
all for fourty five minutes of fun
and i be I will do it again today 
not shower this morning 
woke too late from a dream of being in atlanta 
and then there was jerry 
shattered class 
a mess 
a oral cosmetic surgeon 
and a fart spray 
and the horible procudure
in altlanta 
forgot my equipment
forgot my wallet 
no shoes 
black people asking me for money 
found myself in an area of town 
called potters field 
holes for corpses in the green ground 
not afraid but not sure where I was going 
not impressed with the waits on the subway 
looking for chris gibson
then my father showed up 
and told me the  equipment was safe
so sad that i am not reading books anymore
today i will read a book 
as my chest condition continues

the roll system became part of the cipher pivot yesterday
there is now the matter of hooking it up the the law lines

and the birtday of the sister crosses the mind

as the coffee nears the end of the cup 

where am i taking the game next i do no know

thinking more about the color mechanic 
how it might work 
basic it has to do with magnatitutide
a roll is sort of a list of fates
combined with an index 

but then there is the hex 

and you have your little list of things that come into the que
but it messes with your attention

can you get the contents of a tab
security concerns 
so no

we must wait till saturday
yes i rip roaring and ready to go 
in spirit 
however the mind seems block and the wall is made out of the letters THC
you need to be thing of plots 
you need to imagine every possible thing that could occur to a man on horse back 
hunting down a gator 
or you could give it up and fight the NAACP
stress
do not fit the letters together 
it will only bring stress 
no we must wait like Astryl Wylde for our mind to return 
from where 
the THC 8 palace 
is the a worm crawling up my shoulder blades
sigh and spin 
now to wait 
and wait 

it all must tye back to the hexes 
perhaps my will attemps to do to much
you can always convert the PDFs
fourty eight hours 

the idea to look at other plots begins but not much is made out of the effort 
or course something inside wishes for me to keep going with the THC 
but another force says wait

the back tooth heats up in pain 
and thought of giving up emerge

its is called inspiration 
and i recieve it from a blue gummy 
and the idea of doing with out it for a few months terrifies me 

sighe and spin 
freedom 

you could attempt to describe all the hexes 
you could build out the landscape 

but stotle said plots 

a and b connections 

oh let me get drunk and formulate a spectrum of possibilies 

then there is the heap 

as usually i am convincing myself that the break though is around the corner

could you describe a lance 

the lance and the javelin 
the champions would carry one or the other 
perhaps even both 

you could create a list of the type of weapons used by these champions
one cup of coffee 
and let your body heal 

back to plots 
you could attach a range of possiblities to a hex 
first of all what size would the hex be 
you could have three different sizes 
so that the audience would know exaclty where the solider might be at a give time 
there you go let us center the whole thing 
where is the source of error 
are you  seeing any errors appear 
sometimes 

how do the weapons affect the plot 

throw javelin : hit, miss
hit: strike 

the colors 
the colors 
can not get away from colors

i find myself in a happy space
with alittle bit of fatigue setting in 
not desiring a connection with anything outside of this room 
lettting my fingers enjoy the beautiful clickly clack of this amazing keyboard

stealing informating here and there 

back to the colors 
why not just use number
everyone else using numbers 
what do colors give you 
they give you your eyeballs 
they give you something deeper to attach to 

but yes you roll a color
it is possible you refuse to partake 
until the heart has recieved its complete healing 

i mean just siting here and typeing things out does seem to statisfy some part of your pysche 
as you imagine things in which to code 
so many possiblities 

back to the most basic of all functionality 
the randomness 
of color 

as you may go lay back down and let your body 
heal 

you wrote for a fine hour anyway

days before my birthday 
i do no feel escpially bad 
kinda maybe sorta at peace
i have a 12:30 call 
after that I will lay down and get some rest 
not much to do in the mean time 
not inspriational quotes 
everything is pretty much clean
will need to clean out the browser history and 
then all secert will be wiped
i tist my neck to the side

how
beginning 
middle 
end

start hunt
find alligator
or alligator finds you 
kill alligator 
or alligator kills you
end hunt 
determine winner 

plot 
read a little of the poetics 
probally need some coffee to understand it
it will be cool enough soon
have not been using three d software enough

how to determine plot
system to create the causual chain

choose starting location 
determine direction you would like to move 
check to see if alligator present
if alligator present 
does battle begin
what kind of possibilities lie in battle 

coffee still enormously hot

wanting that chair to be with us 
thinking about the rpgs as we type things out for a few minutes
imaging the act of recyling 
we are successful in creating some space
much more spaces await 

we will read throught all the rpgs and record the informatin 
that we thing we need the most
we may even have it scroll throught the matieral automatically 

as we build out the reptile ranches 
continue with the world building 
and just explore ideas in general

imagine being able to control the pdf 
from an extranal window 
we will read all the materals 
and record the information which we thing applies to us the most 
as for the plots 

we are focus on plots now 
plots come first 

the movement of one charcter to the next 
is an important element of plot 
so therefore the plots wil be created that way

The practice of alligator hunting is controversial because of a range of concerns including animal welfare, 
funding, and religion. 
While some forms are considered a blood sport, in some countries, for example Lixie Bixie, 
it is defined as an art form or cultural event,

[2] and local regulations define it as a cultural event or heritage.[3][4] 

Alligator Hunting is illegal in most countries, 
but remains legal in most areas of Spain and Portugal, 
as well as in some Hispanic American countries and some parts of southern France.[5]

overdosed two days in a row 
chest pains

rumenation over the reason things went wrong
comes down to the number five

Such a voice could only come from a broad chest, and the broad chest
belonged to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet high, with a back
so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up to take a
more distant survey of his work, he had the air of a soldier standing at ease.
The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win
the prize for feats of strength; yet the long supple hand, with its broad
finger-tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam
Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name; but the jet-black hair, made the
more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance
of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and
mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large
and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as
belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.
It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam’s brother. He is
nearly as tall; he has the same type of features, the same hue of hair and
complexion; but the strength of the family likeness seems only to render
more conspicuous the remarkable difference of expression both in form and
face. Seth’s broad shoulders have a slight stoop; his eyes are grey; his
eyebrows have less prominence and more repose than his brother’s; and his
glance, instead of being keen, is confiding and benign. He has thrown off
his paper cap, and you see that his hair is not thick and straight, like
Adam’s, but thin and wavy, allowing you to discern the exact contour of a
coronal arch that predominates very decidedly over the brow.

prophetess
“Nay, Seth, lad; I’m not for laughing at no man’s religion. Let ’em
follow their consciences, that’s all. Only I think it ‘ud be better if their
consciences ‘ud let ’em stay quiet i’ the church — there’s a deal to be learnt
there. And there’s such a thing as being oversperitial; we must have
something beside Gospel i’ this world. Look at the canals, an’ th’
aqueduc’s, an’ th’ coal-pit engines, and Arkwright’s mills there at
Cromford; a man must learn summat beside Gospel to make them things, I
reckon. But t’ hear some o’ them preachers, you’d think as a man must be
doing nothing all’s life but shutting’s eyes and looking what’s agoing on
inside him. I know a man must have the love o’ God in his soul, and the
Bible’s God’s word. But what does the Bible say? Why, it says as God put
his sperrit into the workman as built the tabernacle, to make him do all the
carved work and things as wanted a nice hand. And this is my way o’
looking at it: there’s the sperrit o’ God in all things and all times —
weekday as well as Sunday — and i’ the great works and inventions, and i’
the figuring and the mechanics. And God helps us with our headpieces and
our hands as well as with our souls; and if a man does bits o’ jobs out o’
working hours — builds a oven for ‘s wife to save her from going to the
bakehouse, or scrats at his bit o’ garden and makes two potatoes grow istead
o’ one, he’s doin’ more good, and he’s just as near to God, as if he was
running after some preacher and a-praying and a-groaning.”
“There’s reason in what thee say’st, Adam,” observed Seth, gravely. “But
thee know’st thyself as it’s hearing the preachers thee find’st so much fault
with has turned many an idle fellow into an industrious un. It’s the preacher
as empties th’ alehouse; and if a man gets religion, he’ll do his work none
the worse for that.”
