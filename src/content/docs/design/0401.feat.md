Ranged Attacks
(Agility Combat) Ranged Attacks is the common term referring to attacks over a long distance,
including projectile
and energy weapons,
'and those Powers that allow the inflicting of 'damage over a distance.
Captain Marvel's 'energy attacks,
the Hulk's rock-throwing,
'Storm's lightning'Solts,

and Captain 'America's shield are ail examples of ranged attacks,
Characters do not have to be adjacent in 'order to make ranged attacks.
In general,
ranged attacks start at the attacker,

and proceed in a direct line to the target
(yes,
'Captain America has on many occasions bounced his shield off several targets to hit 'someone from behind,
but this is a Power Stunt using his abilities).
'When using area movement,
range determined by the number of areas the missile,
energy blast,
or whatever passes 'through from stat to finish in a straight line.
If the missile passes through a comer of another area,
that area is counted.
In addition,
each floor of elevation is counted as an area,
When using ranged movement,

'asked is: Has this hero done this sort of thing before? you are playing an established Marvel 'Super Hero,
the question of whether he has done this stunt before or not is determined from the Marvel Comics themselves.
Each time you can spot him using this particular stunt,
that counts as one time.
Example: In 'one issue of X-Men,
Nightcrawler uses his 'power to make three quick teleports,
behind thre separate opponents.
He does it again 'several issues later.
This means he has pulled this Power Stunt twice.
IHyou are playing a hero of your own creation,
or a hero that you have never seen perform this stunt,
this means you hhave never performed it before.
In either 'case,
the Judge may say ""no" to a stunt,
it he feels it unbalances the character.
'The type of FEAT
(made against the Power rank) needed to make a Power Stunt is determined by the number of times your character has tried it.
'+ Never tried it — red FEAT roll * Tiled it up to three times — yellow FEAT roll * ied it more than three times — green FEAT roll {In addition,
a character making a Power 'Stunt must lay out 100 Karma points 10 'make the roll
(in addition to any other Karma he may spend — see Karma).
'Spending the Karma does not guarantee 'Success; it only ensures that yes,
the 'character can try the stunt.
Ifthe stunt is ruled impossible by the Judge,
no Karma is.
spent,
ta player character has tried a stunt more than ten times,
itis considered to be part of his or her bag of tricks for that Power,

and a FEAT roll is not necessary to say fitis possible
(this is similar to purchs

possible,
whether a character can attempt a Power stunt,
what type of result is required,
Whether a character can add a Power,
Talent,
or Contact,
all are judgment calls the 'Judge must make in ordinary play.
The thing about such calls is that what you allow 'and do not allow is up to you.
You can have a "wachoo" campaign with every character Performing all manner of Power stunts,
or a hard,
gritty game where character interaction is supreme
and characters do 'ot try to use their Powers in new
and strange ways.
'The other thing about making such rulings is that the Judge should be fairly conversant in the rules.
The Judge does not hhave to be an absolute exper in all manner of Powers,
but should be knowledgeable 'about what they do
(especially the ones the players control).
Being able to find the rule you are looking for in the books is more important than remembering the rule verbatim.
The players will quickly become absolute experts on their characters' Powers,
and,
in the case of those running will acquire examples of their characters pulling off some incredible Power stunt or another.
While there will be self-appointed experts Cn all manner of Powers,
there will also be those playing the game who have read just 'enough to know what is going on,

and enjoy playing the game.
This is the other reason the Judge should be aware of hs ruleset — not every player will inform the Judge of what he or she can
and cannot do,
until
(perhaps) after the fact.
Being aware of your players' potential
and how it affects your 'campaign is critically important.

Because of this,
Reed spent Years trying to reverse Ben's transforma- tion.
He completely succeeded once,
though Ben was soon returned to his Thing-form as punishment by Galactus.
Alater attempt returned Ben to an ear- lier,
lumpier Thing appearance.
A tempo- rarily adult Franklin Richards returned jen to hs well-known,
rocky exterior.
During this procedure,
Franklin discov- 'ered that Ben had a psychological need to maintain his rocky form,
knowledge Franklin passed on to his father,
who finally felt released from his obligation to "cure" Ben.
'While on a trip of self-discovery on the battle world of the Secret Wars,
Ben unknowingly split into two physically distinct beings,
a completely human Ben Grimm
and a Blen who could change into the Thing at will.
A long duel followed between the two Ben Grimms,
in the conclusion of which the Thing "killed" his human self.
When he returned to Earth,
he discovered that he had always had the ability to switch between his human
and Thing selves.
Now he be- ligves that since he "killed" his human self,
he no longer has that ability.

'without loss of speed.
Making a turn greater than that
(for example,
using the city map in this box,
heading west on 8th Avenue
and turning northeast on Lincoln) reduces the 'character's speed by half.
f the character does not have the speed to make the turn,
that character ends his turn where the turn 'was to take place.
At the start of a turn,
the characters may move in any direction they s0¢ fit.
Vehicles have different limitations according to their type
(see Vehicles,
particularly under Crashes).
Other actions while moving: I the character Is performing other actions while moving,
his or her movement rate is reduced by half.
This does not apply to charging,
but 'does apply to other actions taken at the end 'of a round
(running up
and engaging a foe in slugtest) Eyeballing
and the quarter.
inch rule: When Using the range system,
it may not be necessary to measure off every movement 'and motion ofthe hero.
Ifa hero can run {rom New York to Chicago in six seconds,
i's a good bet he or she can move to the next room in a turn.
Unless the Judge calls for it,
measurement can quickly become 'optional among experienced players.
'With the ranged movement system,
however,
the exact location is more important than with the area movement system.
Itis now important if a hero is on the northeast,
northwest,
southeast or southwest corer of 8th
and Grant.
The arrows on the markers,
comers of the fold-up figures,
etc.
,
determine the exact location,

and it is from these points that the ranged movement is measured.
Itis a simple fact of life that in any game with counters,
maps,
markers,
slices of pizza,
whatever,
things get moved accidentally.
For this reason,
the Quarter-Inch rule can be used.
Ifa hero is within a quarterinch of the location he is heading for,
the Judge 'should consider the move complete.
What this prevents is reducing movement to an 'exact science.

Colorado.
She was the "Grande Dame" ofthe community for a long time,
but eventually she grew restless
and returned to 'the outside world.
She built her home of Whis- er Hill in the Adirondack Mis.
of upstate New York.
She became aware ofthe infant Frank: lin's existence
and powers
and decided that she should offer her services as his govern- 'ss.
When Reed
and Sue learned of her powers,
they agroed: they had been seeking 'Someone who could fill the post of both nanny 'and protector.
Agatha proved she could do 'both when she defeated the three members of the Frightful Four.
Whisper Hill was later de- stroyed.

Nicholas Scratch,

Vertical distances are determined in floors,
'continuing the tradition set forth in the 'original set,
Each floor is 15 feet,
or 5 yards,
in height
(let's have some high ceilings,
here) Climbing is the scaling of by abilities or by Powers that permit such abilities
(Spider-Man's wall 'example).
For a character powers to climb,
enough projections or footholds must be available.

(Climbing a 'normal building would be impossible for 'most mere mortals,
but a drainpipe might 'make matters easier).
A character might climb one floor in altitude per round under favorable conditions
(under unfavorable Conditions,
the Judge may require Agility FEATS to avoid falling).
Certain super-powers such as wall crawling may 'modify this.
Then there are things such as stairs,
ladders,

and fire escapes.
A character may ascend these structures at one floor/round,
with no chance of falling off or down
(of course,
the bad guys they are pursuing may decide to push things down on them,
but that's another barrel of monkeys entirely).
Lastly,
there are elevators.
Elevators move at different speeds: old ones ratte along at 5 floors per round
(up or down}; most rormal ones move at 10 floors per round,
land the fastest
(attached to most ultra-modern buildings,
secret HOs,

and the like) move at 20 per round.
The newer 'elevators operate off runners at the corners,
0 the old trick of cutting the elevator 'cables only works in older buildings.
Downward Movement: Moving down in an 'levator has the same rate as moving up.
Racing down stairs is the normal movement speed,
with one floor equaling one area.
Climbing down is one area per round,
with the noted Agility FEATS
and determination 'of impossibilty 'The major type of downward movement is called Faling.
Falling has the following rates: * First round: 8 floors/round * Second Round: 6 floors/round * Third Round: 10 floors/round Fourth
and following rounds: 20,

the game can see.
In the above example,
the player may ask "Do I see any other robbers in the bank?" The Judge would respond,
"None that you can see.
" Such literal answers have the dual purpose of creating the illusion of realty
(the players are not omnipotetent)
and driving the players crazy
(the players are not omnipotent).
As a rule of thumb,
i a player looks for exact details,
changes position to {gather more information,
or asks more than three general questions,
the Judge can rule that that character's action for that round is 'observing
and go to the next round.
Role-Play the NPCs: A non-player-character is any character not controlied by the players.
This includes all the bad guys,
as 'well as the innocent bystanders,
the forces of the law,
animals,

and other heroes as 'well.
In roie-playing the NPCs,
the Judge gets a chance to do a litle play-acting,
so have fun.
Use different voices
and accents,
try to sound like the character you are portraying
(be it Doctor Doom or the Irish CChief 0' Police).
Voice can transmit clues as well as anything else.
Often the decisions of the NPCs are determined by die rolls,
particularly in the 'case of Popularity FEATS.
Work these results into your character.
fa character has been Friendly to the players throughout the adventure,

and suddenly gets a bad die roll that character does not suddenly become Hostile
(in most circumstances).
The character would lke to help,
but does 'not know the information,
cannot give it out,
is uninterested,
has a pressing 'engagement,
or simply changes the subject.
Finally,
when role-playing NPCs,
use the 'same approach for what they know as for what the players know.
Their information is limited as well.
A low-level flunky might not know exactly what Doctor Octopus is up to 'and no matter what prodding the players bring to bear he cannot reveal more.
Handle Mechanics: The Judge runs the 'combats,
determines what everyone is doing in a single round,

and handles the attacks for the NPCs.
The Judge also determines what FEAT rolls need to made at which time.
The standard mechanics that are the Judge's province are handled in the next section,

SUMMARY: The heroes reunite the shattered aspects of Galactus' per- sonality STARTING: Use this encounter when the heroes bring Gal face-to- face with Actus.
Read the following text to the heroes as they approach 'Actus
(it may prove necessary to 'modify it ifthe heroes have already disrupted the ceremony): Death says,
"it anyone here knows a reason these entities 'should not join together in a state 'of matrimony,
let him speak now fr forever hold his peace.
" ENCOUNTER: As the heroes push through the crowded hall,
astonished {gasps
and whispers rust through the crowd.
Actus turns to the source of the disturbance.
"Who dares inter- fere with this,
the wedding of all wed- dings?" he demands.
'When he sees the heroes,
he raises his hand to strike them down.
Gaea quickly seizes his wrist
and {forces it down.
"Nay,
husband-to-be.
Vii not have my wedding day marred by violence.
" 'As soon as Actus sees Gal,
his 'mouth drops open in astonishment.
He stands motionless fora fll min- his expression changing from 'anger to puzziement to recognition to relief.
Gal grasps his escort's arm 'and cries,
"Stop him,
" beg you! He's.
'a murderer-—do you know how many millions he has killed? Please,
don't let me go! Despite Gal's pleas,
he slowly,
relentiossly shuffles toward Actus.
He drags his escort along as if tunaware they are moving.
Finally,
'Actus reaches out
and grasps Gal by the shoulder.
"At last,
we are com- plete! Gal dissolves before the heroes" 'eyes,

and Actus changes into Galac- tus,

Although Galactus is 'once again returned to form,

"Catching" in the Combat section,
'Those people for whom falling from high distances is a common occurrence
(fighter pilots,
for example) often wear parachutes.
It takes one round for a parachute to deploy.
Parachutes slow the fall to three floors per round,
provided they are not 'overloaded
(most normal parachutes can hold two normal people.
More recent inventions allow parachutes to glide
(see Gliding).
Ordinary chutes will rit with the wind.
Chutes are made of Feeble strength 'material,

and a shredded chute will be of no {good to the character using it.

(watch,
I'll get an argument on this one).
There are vehicles 'and Powers that allow fight.
Vehicles are 'covered in their own section.
The following 'deals with flight resulting from super-human Powers.
'The abilty of flight is determined by the Controlled imbalance of the forces of thrust,
'drag,
weight,

and lit.
This is more complex than we need for our purposes.
The mé thing to consider here is the idea that movement through the ai,
unlike movement along the ground,
is often at higher speeds: itis often harder to turn while fying.
For speeds of characters with Flying Powers,
'see the Long Distance Movernent Table on page 23.
Acceleration: A flying character cannot reach his utimate speed in a single round,
Unless that character's Powers specifically Permit.
The first round of fight,
the Character can move up to his movement as limited by Endurance
(1,
2 or 3 areas).
The speed can be increased by that increment each round until maximum speed is reached.
Example: Storm,
when she had her powers,
Could attain Incredible speed,
reaching 20 areas a turn.
She has Amazing Endurance,
0 she may accelerate up to 3 areas a turn.
On the first turn of flight Storm moves 3 areas,
on the second 6,
on the third 8,
the fourth 12,
the fifth 18,

and the sixth 18,
on the seventh turn
and every turn afterwards Storm can move 20 areas.
Deceleration: Slowing down while in fight is abit simpler.
A character inflight may always halve his current speed
(how fast he 'moved the previous round),
rounding fractions up.

(A character moving 15 areas could slow to 8 areas.
) A character that slows to 0 areas may fall,
unless the nature

'+ Those attacks involving charging
and ramming refer to the Endurance ability.
'The MARVEL SUPER HEROES Advanced Set will elaborate on each type of attack {form,

and define some specialized tricks that are often used in comic books.
'Slugfest
(Fighting Ability Combat) Slugfest combat is a general term referring to hand-to-hand combat.
Itis the most 'common form of battling,

and includes both attacks with the bare fist,

and those with blunt
and edged weapons.
For Slugfest combat to occur,
the combatants must generally be adjacent.
This may be defined by the counter arrows touching,
the points of the stand-up 'counters touching,
or the miniatures touching at the base,
or by any other 'method deemed worthy by the Judge.
Certain Powers,
such as elongation,
may allow a character to engage non-adjacent targets
(examples are Mr.
Fantastic
and Doctor Octopus).
'Slugfest combat is resolved on the Universal Table using the attack Fighting ability.
The result
(white,
green,
yellow,
or red) is then noted on the Effects 'Table directly above the Results Table.
'There are two columns of results depending 'on whether the individual used a blunt attack or edged attack.
'A Blunt Attack is an attack with bare hands,

and Slams still apply) 'Example: The character making the attack above nas Good Body Amon
and may the attack at 10 speed with Good Endurance on an opponent with Excellent 'Body Armor.
The first 20 points of that are 'covered by the target's Body Armor,

and as such are returned to the user.
The attacker takes 20 points,
10 of which are absorbed by his own body armor.
The attacker therefore takes 10 points from his own attack.

In ME 7,
Uatu the Waicher summoned the heroes to recover an immature Cosmic Cube Which the Kree had created.
Unfortu- rately for the heroes
(and the rest of Creation),
the Elders of the Universe hhad also learned of the Cube.
After a Jong sequence of events,
they even- tually gained control of the Cube for a brief time,
Empowering the Cube with their Power Primordial,

Ability FEATS Ability FEATS are those that come directly trom the seven basic abilities: Fighting,
Agility,
Strength,
Endurance,
Reason,
Intuition,

and Psyche.
When making an Ability FEAT,
the specific ability is normally noted in the text
(such as a Psyche FEAT in regards to Mind Contro).
Often a specific 'color FEAT is required,
such as a yellow Endurance FEAT.
The particular FEATS that apply to specific abilities are noted in the Ablities section in the last chapter.
'Two types of Ability FEATS should be discussed in detail at this time,
both of Which revolve around the Strength ability,
The fist is the problem of liting things,
the 'second breaking through other lems.
Lifting Things: The Strength ability,
'combined with the Intensity of an object's 'weight,
determines how much the character can lif.
As noted above,
ling a weight 'more than three ranks below the character's Strength can be considered 'automatic,
those one rank below the character's Strength require a green FEAT; those of equal Intensity to the character's Strength requite a yellow FEAT; those on fone rank higher require a red FEAT; and,
those beyond one rank higher are impossible.
'Weight intensity: Feeble Up to 50 pounds Poor Up to 100 pounds 'Typical Up to 200 pounds Good Up to 400 pounds Excellent Up to 800 pounds Remarkable Up to 2000 pounds

From 1 ton Upto 10 tons requires a yellow FEAT rol 'Over 10 tons

SUMMARY: The heroes encounter the Fenris wolf as he accosts some children.
'STARTING: At the end of Chapter 13,
the heroes may proceed to the Plain of da via Getrrodur's subterr rnean tunnel system.
If they do,
skip this encounter
and proceed directly to Chapter 15.
Otherwise,
read the following text aloud as the heroes reach the edge of Asgard: 'A group of childreyygtand clus- tered just outside tH city wall.
Whimpers,
sobs,

and frightened yells of defiance drift from their tiny throats,
'Twenty yards away,
a wolf paces back
and forth.
He stands nearly five feet tall at the shoulders
and 'must weigh as much as a small horse.
The wolt slavers foamy black saliva from his dark jaws.
'The children bravely point an assortment of meat cleavers,
knives,
carpentry hammers,

and 'clubs at the giant beast.
A small stone arcs from within the crows "
and strikes the brutish canine on " the nose.
The wolf snarls,
then " turns to attack.
ENCOUNTER: The wolf is,
of course,
the Fenris Wolt.
Geirrodur released him in order to raise havoc during Ragnarok.
The statistics of the Fenris Woit are listed in the Resource Book "The children are true Asgardians When they learned what Ragnarok 'meant,
they decided to join their parents on the battlefield.
After orga: nizing into @ company,
they armed themselves with the most dangerous weapons they could find,
Unfortunately,
they met the Fenris Wolf.
Though the wolf might not be 8 tough as an Olympian,
itis much 'more intimidating to a c 'Sif.
As the heroes move to help the children,
a black-haired woman leaps from the wall.
She lands between the children
and their tor- 'mentor,
then raises a gleaming sword to menace the wol.


{rom case to case,
but the Judge is 'encouraged to be as creative
and Upsetting as his players wil let him get away with,
Body Armor has no effect on the initial hit of Grappling attack,
as no damage is done initial.
Charging
(Endurance Attack) Charging combats a form of attack that 'combines movement
and combat.
Whereas 'making any other attack or action halves movement,
a charging character may make his full movement
and stil strike.
Charging is a favored method for heroes trying to 'lose the distance between themselves and.
'an opponent with a range weapon,

and 'certain individuals such as Rhino,
'Juggeraut,

and Bulldozer make this their preferred form of attack 'A character must move at least one area to make a charging attack,
but may move his entire movement rate to reach the combat.
For each area the character moves through before reaching combat,
the attacker gets a +1 CS,
up toa maximum of +3 CS.

(Endurance for figuring this may not be raised beyond Shift Z in any event) Charging attacks are resolved on the Universal Table,
checking under the Charging column of the Erfects Table.
The character making a charging attack may score a Miss,
Ht,
Slam,
or Stun * Accharacter scoring a Miss result inflicts no damage.
In addition,
the 'character continues his move for halt the character's speed
(round up) after the attack.
Any change in direction would require an additional Agility FEAT.
It the straight line passes into some material obstacle,
the character makes an attack on that obstacle instead.
The attacked character may return the attack only if his action was originally following the charge.
'A character scoring a Hit result inflicts upto his maximum current Endurance
(oF his Body Armor rank in damage,
whichever is higher,
plus two additional points of damage for every area covered in the attack.

(A character moving 10 areas with an Endurance of Good

quarters.
There were suites for the Ri- chards,
Ben,

and Johnny; several guest rooms for other FF members
and the extended family,

and the dining
and living areas.
The 32nd floor contained more living areas,
Alicia's studio
(when she was a resident) the medical lab,
the library,

and reference room.
The 33rd floor contained Reed's labo- ratory.
The floor plan changed constantly 2s Reed added additional experiments 'and devices.
In the Computer Center was a lever for activating the magnetic repellors on the 30th floor.
'The ath floor could be considered the actual headquarters.
The computer banks,
monitor banks,
communications ccenter,

and briefing room were all there,
as well as the overfiow from Reed's labo- ratory below.
The Astro-sciences section was tied in to SHIELD's
and Project Starcore's systems.
'The 35th floor contained the hangars for the FF's various vehicles,
storage 'space,

and a machine shop capable of building or repairing the FF's vehicles.
A reinforced door in the corner led to the launching silo for the FF's rocketship.
The vehicles were on platforms that carried them around the floor
and over to the launching hatch The root was flat
and featureless.
A large FF-insignia marked the retractable hatch for launching
and landing vehicles.
Itan FF vehicle approached,
the hatch would open automatically.
There were @ series of observatory domes located at various spots on the root.
Originally a permanent dome was located on the 'corner opposite the rocket silo.
The last dome was closer to the silo but retract- able.
The entire dome could be lowered through the floor to the 35th-floor hangar.
This left the roof completely clear for action
and eliminated the only hiding place for a trespasser.
The observatory equipment included a computersinked telescope
and twin telescopic cameras.
BUILDING AND SECURITY SYSTEMS The walls
and floors of the entire Baxter Building had Remarkable Material Strength.
After the first time the FF's section was demolished,
Reed rebuilt them to have Incredible Material Strength.
Three elevators served Floors 1 through 30.

What is Forever? An appraisal of time that begins with the primal 'explosion
and ends with the collapse 'of the universe's incomprehensible bulk? Or is it something more—a measurement without limits or rue definition,
a calculation of the immeasurable span preceding time 'and continuing long atter All-That-ls 'oases to be? 'Who among us can know? What- 'ver the true nature of Forever,

Compared to Forever,

'And yet,
there are those that know Forever: beings of unimaginable 'and age born with the Uni 'verse itself,

More powerful than,
'gods,
more mysterious than the darkest secretin the blackest heart,
these beings know Forever.
'We call these beings Entities.
By this term,
we mean to describe that which is indescribable.
Perhaps we 'can say they are intangible manifes- tations which embody abstract con- 'cepts.
But this would not be quite correct,
for very often men have seen
and been touched by
and talked to them.
Yet it would be too simple to call them sentient beings,
for they are part of the essence of the universe in a way we can never hope to understand.
Perhaps itis simply best to describe them as something between the abstract
and the tangible: mysterious existences which sprang somehow from the void 'that was Before,

and which will not perish until the universe returns to the lump that will be After.
"This section describes the Entities that appear in Ragnarok

'While only Death
and Galactus sprang directly from the Big Bang which created the universe,
the other entities can truly be said to have 'come from Chaos

What is Doctor Doom up to? Why are 'electrical supplies disappearing without a 'race? A good way of planning an adventure isto figure out a vilain's plot.
Villain's plots have a number of options,
including: * Defeating a hero that has defeated him before.

or the hero fights im,
* Acquiring Material Resources for further criminal activities.

The villain has someone 'else perform his dirty work for him.

and cross-references 'the number with his rank for a result.
Types of FEATS The following are the different types of FEATS called for in the course of the game.
* Ability FEATS are those that rely on one of the seven primary abilities
(Fighting,
Agility,
Strength,
Endurance,
Reason,
Intuition,

and Psyche).
These FEATS 'may be raised or lowered by Talents or the existing situation '+ Power FEATS are those that rely on 'one the hero's individual Powers: a character with Water Control of 'Amazing checks on the Amazing 'column to determine success.
'Talent FEATS are those that rely on the hero's Talents,
where the Talent 'modifies a specific ability for FEATS.
* Popularity FEATS are those used in social interaction,

and use the Popularity rank,

and may be modified by Contacts,
'+ Resource FEATS are used in Connection with the character Resource rank,

and determine if the character can afford a specific item or piece of equipment.
Think of this as a "Credit Check,
" for now — we'll 'explain it further below.
Making FEATs In the past,
the standard procedure has 'been to alow all FEAT rolls,
limited only by the Judge's discretion.
Spider-Man cannot '4 747,
but can probably lt private plane.
Can he lft a corporate jet? This has 'been a Judge's prerogative.
In any event,
the player needed only make a green FEAT to succeed,
In the Advanced Set,
we add the idea of Intensity to determine whether certain FEATS are feasible or not,

and the type of result needed for the FEAT to succeed.
l'a FEAT does not have a given,
stated intensity,
assume that any color result means success.
Combat FEATS have varying degrees of success,

and as such are discussed in full n the combat section.
'An Intensity is set as a rank

Compare the requisite ability against the intensity to determine the color of the FEAT required for success.

A 'major disease may be the result of some radical event that happened to the character,
such as: * Long-term exposure to radiation '* Exposure to carcinogenic substances * Exposure to diseases to which the individual was previously unexposed + Exposure to alien environments In any case,
major disease rolls should be rare,

and limited to only the most extreme conditions for player-characters.

(Spider-Man walking through a crashed alien ship might not merit such a check,
but Spider-Man fighting the Punisher in a Durning asbestos factory might.

The intensity of the FEAT depends on the number of attacks desired: 'Making 2 attacks in the same round — Remarkable Intensity FEAT Making 3 attacks in the same round — 'Amazing Intensity FEAT 'All multiple attacks are made at ~1CS to hit If the Fighting FEAT fas,
only one attack is made at ~3CS.
'The above applies to Slugfest attacks
and Shooting only.
Certain Powers may permit 'multiple attacks as Power Stunts without invoking this rule.
Entangling Weapons: There are a number of bolos,
nets,

and webbing designed as Weapons to entangle a foe.
These hit with an Aglity FEAT,
but if they hit,
the target 'must make an Agility FEAT against the 'material strength of the net,
webbing,

Failure indicates the target is enmeshed 'and may escape by breaking bonds as a Strength FEAT,
or slipping the bonds,
ifthe character has applicable abilties.
Groundstrike: The Groundstrike is a tactic Used by individuals with Energy Powers to inflict concussive damage to a target without fear of instant death.
The idea is to Use the Power to bowl over an opponent 'and do damage with the rock
and earth brought up by the attack.
Ifthe material strength is less than the damage inflicted,
the target will ake damage equal to the 'material strength.
In addition,
if the material is relatively thin,
the strike may open a hole,
'causing the target to fall through
(Agility FEAT to avoid).
The chief function of the Groundstrike is that damage is inflicted on the Force Power Table.
I's disadvantage is that itis hard on the surrounding territory.
'Shooting to Neutralize: I's often a good {dea to try to shoot a weapon out of a miscreant's hand.
This requires a Bullseye result,

and while it inflicts damage,
a Kill result is treated as a Bullseye as well.
This is one of the few cases where a Kill result 'may be reduced.
It may be used only to knock an opponent's weapon out of his 'hand,
'Shooting to Stun: A trick shot,
involving 'grazing the target in such a way as to knock Fim out.

Fire
and Ice 'The following sections deal with particular attack forms
and endangering situations,

and how the Judge should handle them.
Fire: As with most other generally harmful things,
fire has different intensities according tothe size
and combustible 'material
(see Intensity table under "other Intensities").
This is the damage inflicted to those in the fire.
Those up to an area away from the fire take ~3CS damage,
while those up to 2 areas away take ~6CS damage.
Force fields can resist the Heat energy,
as can Body Armor
(though it may 'make the owner of that protection uncomfortable),

and in addition,
there are heroes with resistance to predetermined amounts of heat
and flames.
Fire spreads one area per round if there is sufficient combustible material.
A fire set in a protected hearth without nearby papers to ignite is not going anywhere,
while a fre in a hanger containing jet aircraft fuel has explosive results.
A fire's intensity can be reduced by depriving it of ar,
cooling its heat,
or depriving it of fuel.
Normal fire extinguishers are of Good Intensity against fire
(they reduce the fire's Intensity by 10 Points) ina single area.
Normal Fire Hoses have Remarkable Intensity
and a range of 1 area.
Other amounts of water have effects according to the amount of water used.

(Thor summoning a Monstrous storm to douse the flames will have Monstrous 'success — he will also have a Monstrous-strength downpour on his hands.
) A fire deprived of fuel burns itself 'out in a number of rounds equal to its Intensity.
Etfects of fire on a material vary according to the material in question.
Ifthe flames are lower than the material strength,
the fire will 'not damage the material,
though it will the heat through its substance
(hence an iron bar with one end in a fire can burn someone grabbing the other end).
Ifthe flames are of a higher Intensity than the material strength,
then make a FEAT roll to '300 if the material is 'broken'
(in this case burned through or melted).
The material strength of a burning substance is reduced by ~1CS for FEATS against it.
Ice: The effects of extreme cold on Combat are discussed in the Judging Combat 'section earlier.

2) The players in turn determine what their heroes are doing.
Player's may perform 'more than one action during a turn,
but this may limit the success of othe actions.
The players tel the Judge what their characters are doing.

Initiative is only important when one action may change or override 'another action.

Inative is usually used in combat

In certain situations,
such as defensive actions
(Godging,
blocking,

and evading),
a FEAT roll may be made belore anyone on either sides takes any actions.
These are Pre-Action FEATS

'Special Situations in Combat.
The table also lists certain situations where external factors may affect the combat situation.
'Dancing in the Dark: There are two types of darkness — Night
and Dark.
A Night situation is a reduction of available light,

(city lights,
the 'moon,
the stars),
while a Dark situation is 'one involving the elimination or total 'eduction o light
(in a cavern or windowless.
'building with the lights out,
an overcast night in the country).
Night is considered Typical intensity 'darkness for FEAT rolls.
Maximum sight range is 5 areas,
so weapons
and Powers 'may not be fired beyond that range.
Firing in darkness is done at - 1CS,
though 'normal melee combat may take place.
Dark conditions are considered Excellent Intensity darkness unless stated otherwise
(by Darkness Generation Powers,
for 'example).
Normal sight is limited to the immediate area of the character
(about 2 feet).
All FEAT ros are ~2CS when in Dark conditions,
including combat
and use of Powers.

Atmospheric 'conditions may also attect fighting,

For Intensities,

The Updated Universal Table 'Check out the table on the back cover.
It Jooks similar to the one provided in the Original MARVEL SUPER HEROES Set,
'and indeed it contains all the information of the original,
plus a few other things.
First,
instead of one number,
each ability has a rank range as opposed to a single rank number.
Previously,
a Remarkable 'Strength had a rank number of 30,
rain or shine.
Now,
a Strength anywhere from 26 to 35 is considered to be Remarkable,

and FEATs using Remarkable Strength use this 'column.

'and ifthe target's material strength or Body 'Armor is higher,

Holding One's Fire: a player has initiative,
his character may hold off his attack until 'an opponent is within the best possible range.
In other words,
the opponent
(loser of initiative) may move according to his plans,
but the attacker does not have to attack until the opponent is about to strike,

(A good example is a character defending against a Charging opponent.
That character chooses to hold his attack until the opponent is right on top of him,
then lets loose.
) something massive strike his or her opponent).

and itis possible to select a lower effect than the color rolled for other attacks.
'Attack forms where reduced damage is avallable are Blunt Attacks,
Throwing Blunt,
Energy Powers,
Force Powers,

and Grappling,

and any form of attack that uses the magic code phrase "inflicts up to a certain level of damage.
" Attack forms where its possible to have lesser effects than found on the Battle Effects Table

For first-time Judges it is recommended that pre-generated characters chosen from those listed on Cards be used.

'On this occasion,
Death manifested itself to Dracula as a male rival.
This may be an indication that Death 'adopts the female form in order to 'seduce pliable males into doing its will.
On several occasions,
Death has presented itself to living beings {a8 a skeleton wearing a hooded robe.
Death has also manifested itself in 'order to preside over the death of a long-lived or immortal being,
such as 'an Asgardian or Olympian god.
Pre- 'sumably,
Death felt that such a rare 'addition to its realm required person- al attention.
In order to win tr immortality,
the Grandmaster recent- ly tricked Death into barring all Elders of the Universe from its realm This may prove to be a mistake,
for Death is one of the few beings with the power to avenge itself if it realiz- 5 it was tricked.
Despite the apparent simplicity of Death's drive for more conquests,
'any being foolish enough to believe he truly understands the dark entity may soon regret his arrogance.
Death moves without discernible pattern or logic,
striking whenever 'and wherever i feels compelled to {do $0.
Because of this capricious: ness,
virtually all creatures in the Universe fear Death.
No matter how mighty or powertul they are,
they 'realize they must eventually surre der themselves to its dark realm.
The 'Asgardians

even though they do so at an extremely slow rate.
The Olympian gods do not 'age,
but a sufficiently powerful force 'ean kill them.
Even Galactus,
the only known entity to predate the cre- ation ofthe universe itself,
knows he will someday die
and pass into Death's care.
Therefore,
even such powertul beings as these treat Death with deference
and respect.
The relationship between Death 'and the gods of the dead of the var- 'ous pantheons
(such as Hela and.
Pluto) remains something of a mys- tery to most observers,
though it 'seems apparent that such beings <draw some of their power from Death,


Robots
and Reactivation: Robot PCs
and NPCs that are knocked down to 0 Health
and lose all Endurance Ranks are not 'dead" in a conventional sense,
but may be rebuilt by other characters,
if they may retain most of the parts
and personality.
Repairing such a character would require a Reason FEAT of intensity equal to the highest Abily or Power rank of that character
(if the Vision is deactivated,
as he 'apparently was once in crossing Anninilus' Foree Field,
repairing him is an Unearthly intensity FEAT).
The repaired chal3cter 'etums to play,

Reactivating a robot takes a number of <days equal to the highest Power rank of the character
(the Vision would take 100 days) Robots may suffer disabilities.

this point the Judge has to wing it.
'As Judge,
frst determine in your mind what that FEAT Intensity should be,
without regard to the abilties of the character 'making that FEAT.
A rain-lashed surface would be a bit more slick than a normal steel surface
(listed as Good in the Intensity tables
and under wall-crawiing),
but less slick than a surface coated with oil
(Remarkable).
Hazarding a guess,
the FEAT Intensity might be Excellent.
In the second 'case,
unless the chafacter can Power stunt into the range of heat Fadiation,
the missiles will ind the invisible hero.
Ifthe hero tries to Power stunt,
he may have a Power rank CS chance of evading the missiles.
In cases where there is too much information missing ,
go to a "default Condition.
" This is the last resort of Intensities,

and states that,
if the Intensity is Unknown
and likely unknowable,
the Intensity of the FEAT is equal to the ability 'of the character trying to make the FEAT.
In 'other words,
a yellow FEAT roll result is 'needed for success.
Since most important Intensities are usuaily determined in advance by the Judge or in the adventure itself,
this "default condition" helps to

Falling the FEAT means the the Power 'Stunt has failed.
The manner of failure will 'depend entirely on the situation.
For the wall-crawler trying to grapple,
the Power 'may fall to operate.
For the speedster running in circles,
the whirlwind may be uncontrollable.
For Nightcrawler trying a triple 'port,
he may get only one guy.
The 'Judge is instructed that while the failure 'may be life-endangering,
it should not be initially or immediately deadly.
Talent FEATS 'Talents are used in two fashions.
In the first case,
they may modify the abilities of the character in specific instances.
For example,
take the Science
and Professional Talents.
A Talent in Biology gives you a + 1CS on Reason FEATS which involve Biology.
The players are 'encouraged to use this whenever they can get away with it,
within reason.
While said character with Biology cannot identity the presence of radiation any better than the 'next guy,
he can look at the plant life
and 'rom that deduce
(with his + 1CS) that there is or was a radiation source in the area.

(The moral of the story is,
players should 'get creative when using Talents.
) Certain Talents do not modify Talent FEATS.
'They either provide for specific abilities
(such as First Aid) or special backgrounds
(uch as Mystic Origin or Heir to Fortune).

and 'expanded in the Advanced Set.

FOUR FREEDOMS PLAZA When the Baxter Building was de- stroyed,
Reed took the opportunity to increase the space available for the FF.
His devices had already filled all availa- ble space
and he knew the problem would only get worse.
When the time 'came to design the FF's new headquar- ters,
Reed decided to triple the building's size.
The result was the 1500-foot tal,
100-story Four Freedoms Plaza.
The building is evenly divided between regular tenants
and the FF's headquar- ters.
To make up for the inconvenience the old tenants suffered when the Baxter Building exploded,
Reed offered them increased space in the new building under the previous terms.
The old Baxter tenants now occupy floors 1-50 of FF Plaza,
Floors 51-70 are a butter zone.
Tenants 'on these floors do not have the 99-year,
leases; their floors are rentable on an.
'annual basis.
This provides the FF with room for future expansion when they 'outgrow their present area,
The floors above serve as the FF's headquarters.
The layout is familiar to the FF in that itis similar to that of the Baxter Building.
Floor 71 serves as a reception
and conference area.
Roberta still guards the entrance to the rest of the building,
as she sits merged with her desk.
Floor 72 acts as an inn; guest Suites fil this usually unoccupied floor.
The FF's living quarters occupy floors 73- 75.
There are suites for the Richardses; Ben; Johnny
and Alicia; Crystal,
Luna,

and Maya; Ms.
Marvel; Wyatt;
and She- Hulk.
A waterfilled suite is kept available for aquatic visitors such as Namor or 'Triton; this room is entered from the floor above.
The top floor is the hangar,
which fills the space under the four immense "4's" that top the building.
Because the FAA
and the New York autorities finally 'cracked down on the F's air traffic,
the rocket
and Pogo Plane are no longer housed at the headquarters.
The hangar is now the exclusive domain of the vari- 'ous models of Fantasticars
and Skycy- cles.
The angled walls of the roof slide 'open to provide launching
and landing sites.
BASEMENT 'The FFP's foundation reaches 150 feet into the Manhattan bedrock.
There are ten floors below ground.
Sublevels 1
and 2 are used by the building's maintenance

heroes can apply 'common-sense logie; for instance,
it seems unlikely a wolt can handle a 'sword as well as Sif AFTERMATH: This encounter is 'another way to we heroes! time before they reach the Plain of Ida.
Of course,
they can eliminate the problem by blasting the Wott before Sif engages it.

In any event,
a character who is making a Dodging attack makes any FEAT rolls in that turn at a ~2 CS penalty Dodging is usually used against ranged attacks
and charging attacks.
It has stect against Slugtst
and wrestinglS attacks
(though the character may dodge to 'avoid ranged attacks in conjunction with 'adjacent attacks — this has no effect on those adjacent other than to penalize the dodging character).
Evading isa Fighting FEAT that is used by 'characters who are playing for time,
looking for a weak spot in the opponent's attack
and hoping to avoid getting their bodies splattered over the countryside.
Evading is an etective defensive tactic only against adjacent attackers,
such as those engaged in Slugfest or wrestling combat.
Only a single opponent may be Evaded.
'A character who chooses to Evade 'announces that intention during the declaration phase ofthe turn.
I both sides are evading,
no actual combat occurs — both opponents are engaged in a flurry of feints
and parries
and no real blows are landed,
'The Evading character makes no attacks that round,
but rolls on the Universal Table 'and checks the Evasion column in the Effects Table.
The results are Auto-Hit,
Evasion,
Evasion +1,

and Evasion +2.
'An Autos indicates the character zZigged where he should have zagged,
placing him in the direct line of fire of the opponent.
The result of the 'opponent's attack willbe at least a {green result,
even if a white result was rolled
(tis still possible to be missed by wrestling hold in this fashion,
but Slugfest will aways hit,
'+ An Evasion result indicates the 'character dodged the blow from that particular attacker.
The attacker does no damage.
* An Evasion +1CS or +2CS indicates the character dodged the blow as in the Evasion result,

and also put himself the position to deal a better-placed blow against the foe.
In the next round,

'The Judge may handle such recovery
and healing of Health in two fashions.
Under the first method,
the recovered Health is awarded in a block of points at the defined time.
Ten turns after the damage is taken,
Endurance is recovered.
At precisely one hour,
the Endurance rank number of Health points is healed.
Being attacked by anyone 'one turn before the healing or recovery takes place negates the effects until another similar period of time has passed,
but the hero regains Health in large blocks.
'The second method states that the hero recovers as stated at the ten turn mark,
but that healing occurs gradually over a period Of rest

Judging Power Stunts Players are by
and large as deviously 'creative
and cunning a group of people as 'can be found,

and the group that you as the Judge encounter will likely be better than 'most.
As such creative

they will come up with as many ways to use their abilities as possible,

For any one of these three results to be effective on a target,

the modified Powers.
'Character Modeling.
Modeled characters are probably the most dificult to create,
because they are a joint project between the Judge
and the player Either the player has some favorite hero that has not been Covered,
oF has created one of his own with Powers beyond the bounds of those covered in this text.
'As noted in the Players' Book,
the player can "set" the abilties of a hero by checking the character's abilties against those of the characters
and descriptions listed in the Power Roster tables below.
The Power Rosters are a guideline only.
For characters native to the Marvel Universe,
this table is fairty complete.
Just 'about everyone has fought everyone else in the Marvel Universe,
so a good idea of 'comparative strengths
and weaknesses has already been established.
For completely original characters,
no such history oftheir actions exists.
As a recommendation to 'Judges,
be prepared to knock down the inital abilties of these "new" characters by 'one rank each.
This is for no reason other than to provide some growth for the character in the campaign.
Powers for modelled characters may be similar to those listed in the Players' Book,
derived from those Powers,
or similar to Powers that are noted specially for Particular Marvel Super Heroes.
Totally 'original Powers may be developed,
but itis highly recommended that such Powers have a limitation equal tothe intial Power rank +1CS,
Finally,
modelled characters should have ther intial Karma
and Health set as pre-generated characters i they have a "track record" in the Marvel Universe
(even '0 brief a one as the Osprey).
Ita modelled characteris completely new to the Marvel Universe,
st intial ability scores at the minimum values,
as for generated characters
(with the equivalent lowering of Health
and Karma),
FEATS
and 'The success of character actions is based 'on the FEAT rol.
A player may be trying for 'a green,
yellow,
or red result on a particular FEAT to determine success.
What color is needed is determined by the Intensity of the FEAT.
So who determines the Intensity?

'existence of super-powered heroes
and villains,
very similar to our own Earth.

(Earth-Reality? No,
that's too silly.
) There is 'a New York City in both Earths of similar 'appearance
and construction.
There are also Chicagos,
Pittsburghs,
Birminghams,

and San Franciscos in both Earths.
If you 'want to run a campaign in a familiar area,
tse the neighborhood you know.
The Original Marvel Super Heroes Game this designer ran was based in West Lafayette,
Indiana.
So if you aye inclined in that direction,
create a M&s¥el-Universe version of your home town.
Any maps you have of the area can be used to show locations of your heroes in battle
(1 area = 1/20th of a mil).
There will be differences,
of course,
since the Marvel-city is not the real world.
The Hero's secret base on the 23d floor of an office building isin reality an Engineering office,

and the Invading forces from Saturn tore up the Marvel Earth Version of the riverside park,
not the real one.
'The City maps provided in this
and previous products can be used to create your own 'space for bad guys
and good guys to batle.
'The maps do not have to represent New 'York
(though most of them do in our encounters) but can simulate anywhere you want to have the heroes duke it out with villains.
In addition,
you can use the maps {for models of your own campaign city.
Using New York as opposed to a general 'area is up to the Judge,

and each has its 'own advantages.
In a known city you can use a well-known location that all the players are familiar with as a backdrop for a Crime,

and te in small crimes that occur 'about the city with the campaign.
Using New York
(assuming you the Judge are not 'a native of New York) is advantageous in that itis far away,

and the battles are
(for the most part) imaginary,
plus the fact that New York is crawling with super-powered {oes
and felons.
Either option works just as well.
Running Adventures 'Once you have the world
and the players,
you need a script for them to follow: an adventure.
An adventure is a set of preplanned encounters that make up an 'evening's
(or several evenings') enjoyable Playing of the Marvel Super Heroes game 'system.
As Judge you can set up your own 'adventures,
or use ones that have been Published by TSR as adventures or bases for your own designs.

Villains' changes in Popularity are summarized Botetied byhowo a0 Pop Deteating hero Hopop Deteating other vilain te Pop Imprisoned "5 Pop Making Proclamation or challenge +5 op.
These numbers are larger than those for player-characters,
because villains get less play in general than player-characters.
Villains acquire Resources to make purchases
and fund inventions.

'The Kill result is potentially the most dangerous for the user
(and definitely the target).
A Kill result may be checked for as the result of an Energy attack,
an Edged altack in Slugfest,
or a Shooting attack.
It may also be called for by reducing a character's total health to 0 — see Life,
Death,

and Health,

'The target receiving a Kill result makes an Endurance FEAT on the Universal Table,

There are three results on this table.

The characteris dying

A hero who kills wil lose all Karma
(check under the Karma section in the next chapter Powers in Combat Usually a character's superhuman Powers 'can be wielded in combat,
depending on the circumstances.
Those that depend on 'concentration may be prevented,
while those powers that derive from a weapon 'may be foiled if the hero is kept from that Weapon.
This section covers a few of the 'more common Powers that turn up in combat.
Body Armor.
The key to withstanding attacks,
a characters's Body Armor reduces potential damage by the Power rank 'number of the armor.
Ifa character has 'Monstrous
(75) Body Armor,
then any
and all attacks reduce the damage by 75.
Damage reduced below 0 is counted as no damage,
'and the target cannot be affected by a Stun,
'Slam,
or Kill result from that attack.
For 'example,
if a dagger
(10 points damage) is thrown at a hero with Amazing
(50) Body 'Armor,
there is no effect from the attack 'even it the attacker rolled a Kill result.
Body 'Armor protects the character from each
and 'every physical attack.
If five goons inflict 10 points damage on the hero with Excellent Body Armor,
then none of those attacks succeed.
'The above applies to all attack forms except

'* Those characters with Endurances between Poor
and Excellent may move {wo areas per turn.
'* Those characters with Endurances of Remarkable or higher may move three areas per turn,
In addition,
Powers may allow a hero to 'move faster than his Endurance limits.
Also,
vehicles will aliow faster movement than is 'normally possible.

(See Vehicles) When using fold-up figures,
the forward corner of the hero is considered to be the 'exact location of the hero.
When using 'counters,
the tip ofthe arrow is the exact location.
When using miniatures,
consider the leading edge of the figure's base to be the exact location Ranged Movement With the MARVEL SUPER HEROES: 'Advanced Set,
we introduce the idea of Ranged Movement.
One of the cut-out sheets is a range ruler,
marked in halt-area segments.
One area is about halt a city block,
or 44 yards for our purposes.
For those familiar wth the idea of rulers,
1 area equals about 2" on out outdoor mars.
'Maps of smaller areas have a scal provided to indicate the range in areas.
Using ranged movement the hero can ignore the defined areas on the map.
The character may move in any direction,
'subject to intervening walls,
type of ground,

and elevation.
Endurance also affects ranged movement.
'+ Ahero with a current Endurance of Feeble may move only one area per turn,
a maximum of 44 yards '© Aero with an Endurance of Poor to Excellent may move a maximum of two areas per turn,
or 88 yards.
* Ahero with an Endurance of Remarkable or better may move a maximum of three areas per turn or 182 yards.
'As with area movement,
ranged movement 'may be further increased by devices or Powers.
Ranged movement is more exact than area 'movement,
but is more complex.
In area 'movement,
how far the hero can move is limited by the area borders on the map.
In Ranged movement,
the character may move more freely,
but is further limited by the terrain passed through,
When using ranged movement,

and Impossible FEATS: The Players' Book states that a FEAT can be considered Automatic if the Intensity is three ranks lower than the Ability being checked,

and Impossible f the Intensity is more than one rank above the 'one being checked.
This is a general rule for handling FEATS,
though the Judge may bend it at his discretion.
A Judge may ask for a FEAT roll for Automatic actions,
or permit a FEAT for impossible actions under limited circumstances:

Actus has laid his plans well: Although the Asgardians will defeat 'Ymir's Giants,

Example: Several heroes with superior 'speed,

Beast also has "speed" Power that he uses to sprint for Short distances.
The two Powers are both 'Speed related,
but Beasts is at a much more severe

For Beast to tty the "create a whirlwind" Power stunt would make litle sense,

and the Judge Would reject it on that count — it does not 'make sense the way the character 'operates.
A character with a more powerful speed factor might try it,
Bt generate a less Powerful column of air
and as such be less Successful than the two speedsters.
'The above example was an "easy call" Creating a Power stunt that most characters familiar with the Beast would not try.

The Marvel Universe — An Overview 'What makes the Marvel Universe,

and the Earth of the Marvel Universe,
so special? First,
there was a visit in mankind's dim past by a powerful space-god race known {as the Colestials.
The Celestials took primitive man
and created two related races,
Eternals
and Deviants.
The Colestials also put a half-twist in one of the 'genes of Marvel Universe humanity as well,
'giving mankind the potential to mutate in a Positive manner under increased ambient radioactivity.
The slight rise in background radioactivity since the war accounts for the ever-growing number of Mutants that are Popping up in the Marvel Universe,
as well as the genetic potential that converted Bruce Banner into the Hulk
and created the Fantastic Four.
It may be speculated that the Celestial are unique to Marvel-Earth's dimension,

and similar dimensions,
such as that of the Squadron Supreme,
evolved a far fewer number of heroes as a result.
'Second,
Marvel Earth is the home of more than the human race.
In addition to Eternals
and Deviants,
there are the Kree-spawned Inhumans
and the aquatic people of Atlantis.
Third,
Marvel Earth is aligned with the Cosmic Axis,
a great whee! of inter-dimensional power that makes Earth critica to other-dimensional beings,
including Asgard,
Olympus,
Limbo,

and Mephisto's realm,

and the Bark Dimension of our own.
Lastly,
Marvel Earth is located near a prominent natural warp nexus-point,
a gap into hyperspace that makes it easy to travel between the stars.
This warp nexus-point is used by the Shi'ar,
Skrulls,

and Kree,
bringing them into interactions with the natives of Marvel Earth,
For these reasons,
Marvel Earth isthe place to be fora heroic campaign.
It has a rich,
'background
and the potential for a great number of super-powered heroes
and foes.

Fearing that one 'ot his children would usurp his throne,
Cronus sent each of his new- born children to the darkest region of Hades.
Eventually,
Rhea rebelled at this mistreatment oftheir children; she secretly gave birth to Zeus
and sent him to grow up with Gaea.
Zeus returned as an adult

Individuals can escape a microverse by rapid expansion of the same degree that originally reduced them.
Several nnexus-points have been discovered to various microverses,

and certain individuals have access to technology that allows them to travel between our continuum
and theirs
(euch as Henry Pym
and the Fantastic Four).
'Negative Zone: The Negative Zone is an anti-matter universe that was originally discovered
and accessed on Earth by Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.
The devices by which he accessed this Zone were 'contained in the Baxter Building,

and with that building's destruction,
the Zone portal was placed in near-Earth orbit,

and then finally closed.
Whether the zone can be accessed by others is a matter of debate.
'Anti-mmatter

so there isa distortion area between the Zone itself
and our universe.
This <istortion area converts matter that enters

the character is distracted,
the attacker is playing possum
(the target does not anticipate an attack),
the attack comes from 'an unsuspected quarter
(an ally or 'supposed friend makes the attack).
'Characters with extraordinary senses
(ike Daredevil) or danger senses
(ike Rogue,
Franklin Richards,

and Spider-Man) cannot 'be Blindsided in normal circumstances.
Under special circumstances,
though,
Blindsiding these characters can be Possible.
Spider-Man was once Biindsided by Aunt May,
as his vaunted spider-sense {did not recognize the dear sweet lady with the lead pipe as a threat — let this be a lesson to us all 'Shielding: This tactic involves putting 'something between the target
and the attacker,
usually an inanimate object but sometimes,
in the case of hero leaping into the fray to stop an attack on another individual,
a character himself In the first case,
the hero may decide to use something as a shield as an inital action or as a changed action after initiative is rolled,
{Hits an intial action,
the hero may perform another action in addition to the action.
fa changed action,
the hero may perform no other action that round than shielding.
In either case,
all other FEATS attempted in that round,
including combat are ~ 20S.
Unless the object used as a shield is a device or object commonly used by the hero in that way
(the hero is comfortable using the device defensively).
The material strength of the item is used as a form of Body Armor against the attack
(if a garbage can lids used as a shield,
it will provide Poor
(4) protection).
This applies only to physical attacks
and similar attacks that 'may be deflected in this manner.
This form of defense may be used against Slugfest,
Throwing,
Shooting,

and Charging attacks,
'but not Grappling
and Grabbing attacks.
The hero may also provide a form of shielding to other targets within the same 'area
(or within a half-area for ranged movement) by putting his own body in the way of an attack directed against another.
'The hero may make this decision only in the decision section of the turn,

and then if the hero is closer to the target than the attacker
(therefore its only useful against Shooting,
'Throwing,

and Charging attacks).
The hero {or an object the hero is carrying,
asin the first section) interposes himself in the line of fire
and is considered the target instead of the intended target 'Example: Spider Man is standing next to the Mayor when he sees the barrel of a

'Regaining Consciousness: A character 'unconscious from the result of a Stun regains consciousness in 1-10 turns,

and 'may act normally from there on.
A character with 0 Health isktnconscious for 1-10 turns,
then can make a Endurance FEAT.
Failure indicates the character is stil unconscious; 'check again in 1-10 turns.
Success indicates the character has regained 'consciousness,

and has Health equal to his Endurance rank Recovery: Ten turns after a character takes 'damage,
he regains Health equal to the Endurance rank number,
provided the 'character is not knocked unconscious.
This Recovery only applies ifthe character is not further damaged within that time period.
I a 'character is damaged,
steps out,

and then is damaged again before Recovery takes place,
then only Healing is possibi.
Recovery may take place only once per day.
Healing: A character normally heals his Endurance rank number in the hour
(600 turns) following the last damage.
If the character takes further damage during that period,
then the time is measured from that point.
Characters with special ablities may be able to heal for greater amounts or at faster rates.
This rate is doubled by bedrest 'and medical supervision
(doctors or hospitals),

by raising the cdt8ts required one 'notch for Neutral NPCs,

and two notches: for Untriendly NPCS.
This means the Unfriendly NPCs will at best lose your request
and misfile your information,
but that is how a bureaucracy works.
Use common sense with the table above.
'Common or well-known information would be available with no need to check
(you don't have to roll to check time
and temperature).
Similarly,
a Contact will only know about things limited in his field or 'experience.

'The amount
and type of equipment will vary {rom Contact to Contact
and depend on what the player-character is after
and who his Contact is in the organization.
Organizations are generally able to lend out 'materials that cost less than their own Resource rank
(see the Power Rosters for a 'Quide).
Organizations will have equipment of higher Resource rank,
but this is the result of long hours
and years of work.
Further,
any such item that exceeds the Resource rank is considered a Unique item for the purpose of column shifts.

in order to fil them in later as the campaign exists.
This may result in the players suddenly turning up a long-lost uncle in the military,

Ifthe opponent is fighting,
or 'engaged in Slugfest or wrestling,
there is a -3CS to hit wth Missile weapons.
Whether 'or nota target is fighting is determined 'when the attacker fires.
Ifthe attacker gets initiative in the round the opponent tres to 'escape,
the attacker has a +30S — otherwise,
he has a ~3CS.
'Luring: Luring is a tactic by which the character makes himself a target in order to encourage his opponent into attacking him,
whether to keep the opponent from attacking others,
lead the character into an Uninhabited area,
or to persuade the 'opponent to throw a punch or make a charge,
only to jump out of the way at the last moment.
A character trying to Lure states so.
The opponent gets a +2CS on attacks,
but at the moment of attack,
the defender can pull a defensive move of his 'or her choice.
Ifthe attack misses,
the lured character will hit whatever was directly behind the luring character
(the character's choice),
Using Karma in Combat: Karma is delved into deeply in the next chapter,
but since it 'has an important effect on combat it should be mentioned here.
Karma is used to 'manipulate the die rolls on the Universal 'Table.
When a character decides to spend Karma,
the player simply announces it.
You automatically spend 10 Karma points by 'saying that simple phrase.
You can spend more,
but 10 points is the requirement for making the statement.
On the die roll you are modifying
(always the one immediately after the announcement),
you add the number of points equal to the amount of Karma you spend
(atleast 10,
the amount Yyou spent to start with).
Other uses of Karma are described in the Karma section.
Life,
Death,

and Health This is one of the most important sections.
Yet covered.
In combat,
we noted that Various attack forms inflicted various types 'of damage — a strike with the bare fists inflicts up to the attacker's maximum Strength.
This may be modified by Body 'Armor,
tactics,

and other stuf,
but the end result is a number,
which is deducted from 'your Health score.
What happens when Health reaches 0? 'Well,
your character just might perish,
A character that reaches 0 Health becomes 'unconscious
and stays that way for at least 1-10 rounds.
The player rolls an Endurance FEAT for the character
and consults the Kill column of the Effects Table.
Ifthe result is

sniper rifle sticking out of a window.
Spidey acts to shield the Mayor,
making himself the target ofthe attack.
Were Captain America standing next to the Mayor inthis situation,
then he could bring up his shield
(a 'common object used for this purpose) to protect the Mayor
and himself
(the attack is considered to be against Captair but his shield may deflect it).
Flight
and Fight: A few additional rules apply to characters engaged in combat while in fight: '© A character in flight can be slammed regardless of the characte comparative Endurance.
This is because the character is not moored to anything,
'+ Acharacter in fight may Charge with 'normal limitations.
I the flying character is engaged in a Power dive
(dropping straight down),
the character can gain a column shift of +4CS
(with resulting possible damage for self as well).
This applies only to flying characters intent 'on diving at the target,
not to characters leaping,
jumping,
oF falling from high distances
(they receive the +3 CS maximum),
Firing at a Moving Target: A character who is moving is harder to ht.
A ~ 1CS applies to any target moving up to five areas that,
round; a ~2CS applies to those against targets moving up to 10 areas that turn,

and ~4CS to those moving faster.
The N exception to this is attacks on a character 'who is Charging directly atthe fier — other than the target getting rapidly larger,
there is no difference in location 'Ambush: Ok,
how many times have you 'seen this in the comics — the bad guy is right around the corner,
pistol drawn,
'waiting for Moon Knight to come around the comer and.
.
.
Blam! The Ambush is an attack set up against a certain location.
As soon as any character enters that location,
the attack occurs.
Karma is spent when the attack is set up,
not made.
An Ambush gains a +10S tohit.
'Aiming
(Optional): This form of attack is for Use with Shooting,
Throwing,

and Powers,
in situations where the attacker has the luxury of spending a turn aiming his weapon without fring.
A character Aiming for a turn gains a +1CS to hit.
Point Blank Range: There are sometimes 'cases where a firer would have to be really trying to miss — you know,
repulsor up 'against the bad guy's head,
etc.
A Shooting character who is adjacent to a nonfighting,


Negative Popularity: There are charismatic bad guys like Doctor Doom,
whose very evil bends others to their wil 'There are also those powerful characters such as Rhino
and Juggernaut,
from whom 'people flee.
Finally,
there are heroes,
who through bad press or prejudice
(mutants) suffer from a negative Popularity.
Negative Popularity operates as positive Popularity,
save that it ignores whether the target is friendly,
neutral,
or unfriendly.
Everything is a yollow FEAT.
The only 'modifier that comes into play is ifthe request isin the target's best interests "Run,
you dots!" is in the targets interest 'Characters with negative Popularity can ever approach individuals other than 'Contacts for items
and favors
(which is why theft is always a major part of criminal behavior).
'A Negative Popularity is represented as a minus "~" before the word,
such as Typical"
(5 Popularity).
A character with 'negative Popularity suffers penalties in receiving Karma
(see Karma).
Resource FEATs Resources are modified in the Advanced 'Set to cut down on the paperwork.
AS things stood previously in the Original Set,
Characters gained Resources like money.
They had a physical amount of Resource Points,

and everything cost a cert amount of RPs.
This may work for Peter Parker,
who has to make the rent every month,
but for millionaire Tony Stark who can buy roadsters out of petty cash,
this is a bit harder to handle.
For this reason the Advanced Set creates the Resource FEAT.
Allitems have a Resource rank instead of a cost.
This is roughly equivalent to the previous set cost.
The Resource ranks of most common items are iste in Chapter 4: Hardware,
Mage,

and More.
'o purchase anything,
a character must make a Resource FEAT.
This is the 'equivalent of a credit check,
or rattling the piggy bank,
or checking the bank account to see how much cash is available.
This is 'over
and above that amount necessary to get by on,
'A Resource FEAT may be made by a 'character once per week.
Ifa Resource FEAT has been made by a character in the previous seven days,
any Resource FEATS following automatically fal

at slower speeds.
If moving at speed two ranks lower,
no Endurance check is 'needed.
Captain America need not make a 'check more than once per hour if moving at 15 mph,
Exceptions to the above: All this applies to those heroes who move by their own actions,
such as running,
swimming or flying,
Those who fly by means of devices,
those in vehicles,

and any
and all robots are immune to this effect,
as are those with Unearthly or higher Endurances.
'Speed FEATS: There are occasionally times when a character must move faster than he or she has ever moved before,
in 'order to save a life.
A hero may move the 'equivalent of one additional area
(by area or ranged movement if the hero makes @ yellow Strength FEAT rol.
A green result indicates the FEAT was unsuccessful,

and a white result indicates the hero,
ah,
tripped
and lost control,

and will continue moving that direction as if a Slam result was Counted against the character.
A hero may 'ot increase his or her speed more than 'one arealround
(15 mph) in any attempt.
Teleporters: There are an increasing 'number of heroes
and villains with teleportation Powers,
including Cloak,
Vanisher,
Nightcrawler,

and Sidewinder.
For this reason,
a few notes on teleporters are Included here.
'The Teleporter Power rank number indicates the maximum distance the hero or villain can 'port as ifthe character were flying.
Unlike flying,
the distance between the two is covered instantaneously without the hero passing between those points.
No 'speed is involved,
unless that character 'was moving before the 'port.


Running a Cosmic Adventure Like any other role-playing adven- ture,
a cosmic level adventure requires creativity
and energy to run.
But because of its scope,
the rami Cations ofits resolution,

and the power of the characters involved,
a Cosmic adventure requires even 'more effort.

Ranged attack is resolved on the Universal 'Table using the attacker's Agility ability.
The result is then noted on the Effects Table.
'There are five different types of ranged altack listed on this table: Shooting.
{including most projectile weapons),
Edged 'Throwing,
Blunt Throwing,
Energy Powers,

and Concussive Powers
(Force Attacks).
'A Shooting Attack is the most "normal" form of ranged attack,

and consists of using 'weapon like a handgun,
rifle,
or tof destruction that is all too 'common in the USA.
A character making a shooting attack may score a Miss,
Hit,
Bullseye,
or Kill result.
A Shooting Attack 'may never be reduced by the attacker in effect or damage,
A character scoring a Miss result 'misses the intended target.
The missile Continues to fly,

and the Judge may,
if hhe deoms circumstances warrant it,
'make a second roll to see ifthe attack hits another target in the same general 'area
and path of the weapon
(this is why shooting into a crowd or a gasoline storage shed is known as "a bad idea") * Acharacter scoring a Hit result will inflict damage according to the weapon used
(see Weapons).
Some specialized 'weapons inflict no damage,
but instead call for an Endurance FEAT
(Mercy Bullets).
* Acharacter scoring a Bullseye result 'does damage as for a normal Hit result.
'A Bullseye is used if the characteris.

Check on the Kill result table.
Note that there is a 'greater chance of killing with a shooting,
'edged weapon,
or energy attack than for any other type.
'An Edged Throwing Attack involves throwing a sharp,
edged weapon such as a knife or shuriken at the target.
A character 'making this attack may score a Miss,
Hit,
'Stun,
or Kill result.
An edged throwing attack may never be reduced in effect

'Example: Turk
(NPC)
and Daredevil
(PC) are in a fight in a barroom.
There is a gun lying on the floor.
You
(the Judge) decide Turk
(the character you control) should make a dive for the gun.
The Daredevil player decides to kick the loose gun away
and tells you so.
The Daredevil player grabs initiative.
Daredovil wil likely kick the gun 'away before Turk reaches it,
0 itis time to te-examine Turk's options.
Using Daredevil' distraction to dive for cover 'sounds lke a good idea.
Make a yellow Alty FEAT for Turk.
Success indicates the attempt to change his action is successful,
'and Turk can try to dive behind a table
(Agility FEAT at ~ 1CS).
Failure indicates that Turk dove for the gun,
which was.
kicked away by Daredevil Turks flat on the floor in front of Daredevil,

and ~ 1CS on any actions he takes that round.
At the start 'of next round Turk no longer has the ~1CS,
but you,
the Judge,
should decide Turk's action inthis situation I,
m the above example,
the Judge determined to go ahead with Turk trying for the gun,
on the off chance that Daredevil might miss the kick,
no penalty would apply,
though ifthe gun were kicked away Turk 'would be in the same general position as it he tried
and failed
(on the floor in front of Daredevi).
The Pre-Action part of the turn is when Certain actions may occur that are not 'controlled by initiative.
These include timed devices,
such as bombs exploding,
trap doors opening,

and timed bank vaults tnlocking.
These actions can occur here because they may catch the villains
and heroes alike off-guard,
negating their actions for a round.
Column Shits in combat: The Column Shit Table summarizes the various factors that may shif the column in combat.
Column Shifts may be applied to hts,
to damage,
or to all FEATs.
Column shits that affect hits shit the resuits column used tothe right o let,
depending on whether the shit is posiive 'or negatve.
An atack using Amazing Aaiity that recelves a +1CS willbe resolved on the Monstrous column instead.
Make all columm shifts before the dice are rolled.
CColumn shits that affect damage alter the amount of damage inflicted depending on 'whether the shift was to the right

characters already have their limitations stated in their character descriptions
(for 'example,
Nightcrawler's "Blending" Power only functions in dark locations).
Suggested limitations,

and the maximum rank to which 'a Power should be raised by these limitations,
are detailed on page 9 of the Players' Book.
In goneral,
when assigning limitations,
the Judge should think of them as difficult but 'not impossible.
Wall-crawling that only works in deep space is nearly useless to the player with that Power,
in particular ifthe player is creating a character for an lrban-style campaign.
Use the limitations to form the tenor of your own campaign,

and to prevent Powers that are too strong from Lupsetting the balance.
{ta player is raising a Power by accepting tations,
the player may reject the 'Judge's limitation
and choose to have his Power atthe original unenhanced level
(no 'second chances).
A player may not so feject a limitation when the limitation is called for by the Power.
Powers that require limitations are generally more powerful than 'most.
The Judge should set the restriction according tothe initial Power rank of the limitation-requiring power.

(This is a case where taking a Power at a relatively low rank — with a minor limitation —
and increasing it through experience is in the player's best interest.
) 'To determine the limitations on a character attempting to raise multiple Powers with a ingle limitation,
take the highest maximum rank
and raise it by +1CS for each 'additional Power being raised to determine a suitable limitation.
Ifa character had three Powers,
the highest of which would be raised one rank to Excellent,
but wishes to raise all three Powers by a limitation,
then the Judge would look under the Maximum of Incredible table for suitable limitations,
'Judge's Option: If most or all of a Character's super-human Powers a 'combined under a single limitation,
the 'Judge may assign as a limitation the Power 'Alter Ego.
How can an Alter Ego,
defined as 'a Power,
be a limitation? In this case the 'Judge controls the transformation from the 'Alter Ego to the hero
and vice versa,
either by some action,
word,
deed,
or situation.
In addition,
there may be unique situations
(such as exposure to exotic radiation,
or being struck by lightning) that may force a transformation from hero to alter ego involuntarily.
The player may negate these effects by "purchasing" the Alter Ego Power at the level equal to the maximum of

Geirrodur's Trolls.
If the heroes Uncovered
and disrupted Geirrodur's plan to attack the Asgardians from beneath the battlefield,
the Fock 'Tolls do not participate in ths battle.

(See Chapter 13.
) Otherwise,
the 'Tolls attack just when it appears the Asgardians will prevail.
In this case,
the heroes must keep Actus,
Pluto,
Aresh$ind Hercules occupied for 14 turns instead of just ten.
Zeus.
If Zeus is tree,
he may try to 'order the Olympians not to attack
(i he isa player character,
the player 'must think of this.
Otherwise,
he does so automaticaly) His order results in two things: Hercules abandons the battle,

and the Olympian hosts are disheartened.
Reduce by half the 'number of tums the heroes must keep 'Actus
and company occupied.
Death.
Death's bargain withthe 'Olympians does not include wholesale slaughter.

(Aithough powerful enough to wipe any army from the field,
Death Is subject to certain cosmic restrictions 'beyond man's comprehension ) Death's participation is limited to 'negating the effects of any magic used 'on behalf of the Asgardians.

(So Dr.
'Strange is powerless.
) Should the heroes fail to keep Actus
and compa- 'ny occupied long enough for the 'Asgardians to prevail,
Death brings the conflict to a quick end by revealing hher true visage to the Asgardians.
The 'Asgardians flee in teror,
Failing to Stop Loki.
The Asgar- dians sleep through Ragnarok i the heroes do not prevent Loki from dis- ppensing his sleep potion.

(Should the heroes think of a way to awaken the 'entire army,
simply run the encounter 'a if they had stopped Loki) Actus,
Pluto,
Ares,

and Hercules attack the heroes while the Olympian fleet lands.

(Zeus may convince Hercules 3 10 participate in the battle; see "Zeus" above.
) AFTERMATH: Ifthe Asgardians pre- vail,
turn to Chapter 17.
If the Olym- pians prevail,
turn to Chapter 18.

Success 'means that he keeps Mrs.

'Example: Tony Stark has an Excellent Resource rank.
He wants to buy a car with ' Good rank.
He can do so with a green FEAT
(Ialure indicates a cash flow problem —he doesn't have it at the moment).
He 'can pay for a night on the town

a Large Corporation with Incredible Resources.
Incredible Resources allow them to buy their boss a car for office Use,

Combined
and Multiple FEATS Combined Actions: Individuals may help teach other in performing FEATS
(lifting a Car,
researching the function of an alien device,
etc.
).
Check the ability both characters are using.
Ifthe lower of the two characters is within one rank of the higher,
the character withthe higher ability receives a + 1CS benefit to the FEAT.
This benefit may be used in cases of using 'complementary Powers for the same FEAT 'as well,
provided that Power aids the situation Example One: Vision,
with Amazing
(60) Strength,
helps She-Hulk
(Monstrous
(75) Strength) pull up an overturned crane.
The Column checked for the FEAT is Unearthly
(Monstrous shifted one to the right).
Example Two: Sunspot,
with Remarkable
(30) Strength,
helps She-Hulk lift up the crane.
The column checked is stil Monstrous,
since Sunspot's Strength is significantly lower than She-Hulk'.
Example Three: Shaman summons a wind 'of Amazing
(60) intensity to help She-Hulk lit the crane.
Should the Judge decide that the power complements the ability that is being checked,
the FEAT is rolled on the Unearthly column.
Otherwise,
itis rolled on the Monstrous column.

(Ifthe Judge has good reason,
such as the wind blowing up a lot of stinging dust,
ne may make the FEAT an Amazing FEAT owing to the added difficulty).

Friendly characters
and 'organizations include: *+ Close friends

Describe situations: The Judge is the eyes,
'ars,

and other senses of the players.
The 'Judge tells the players what they see from the viewpoint of the characters.
Ita hero walks by a bank in the middle of a hold-up the Judge might say,
"You see a brown 'sedan in front of the Last National Bank,
its 'engine running.
Looking through the plate {glass window into the bank,
you see a pair 'of men in stocking masks with handguns making an illegal withdrawal.
The bank Patrons are lying on the floor.
" From the players' viewpoint,
a third robber just inside the door is not visible,
so the Judge makes.
'no mention of him until the player-character is in a position to sense him
(or the third robber makes himself known by attacking the hero).
'Answer questions
and clarity statements: In any described situation,
there will always 'be questions.
I's the nature of the game for payers to try to gather as much information 'as possible because ita) gives them the 'best chance to understand the situation
and react accordingly,

and b) it eats up time nti they or their comrades can come up with an idea to handle the situation.
With both of these practices in mind,
the best type of answers to give are clear
and brief,

based upon what the characters in

THE BAXTER BUILDING The Baxter Building was the Fantastic Four's original headquarters.
It was a 35- story building located at 42nd Street
and 'Madison Avenue in Manhattan.
While the popular belief is that the Baxter Building 'was built
and entirely occupied by the FF,
in fact they were originally only tenants who rented the top five floors.
The build- ling was originally constructed in 1949 by the Leland Baxter Paper Company.
Bé cause the building was originally in- tended to be a high-rise industrial site,
each floor was given a ceiling height of 24 feet.
When the FF were first considering moving to NYC,
Reed found the Baxter's 'empty top five floors perfect for their needs.
He bought that section of the building outright,
though the FF contin- ued to pay monthly service fees.
When the FF were in a tight financial situation a year later,
Reed resold the FF's floors to Baxter.
As tenants,
the FF had many problems with Mr.
Collins,
the building 'manager.
Whereas Mr.
Collins had orig nally been delighted that a real super- 'hero team was moving into his building,
he soon began to see the problems in 'such a situation.
When Dr.
Doom lifted the entire building into deep space,
rela- tions cooled between the manager
and his tenants.
Other tenants worried that their offices might become battlegrounds 'and,
as their leases ended,
many of the 'building's original tenants did not renew.
Nor did new tenants appear to fill the vacancies.
In desperation Mr.
Collins offered all tenants ironclad,
99-year teases with significant discounts in their rents.
Still,
problems continued.
Occasionally either the Thing or a foe would be driven downward through the building,
tearing a shaft through floor after floor.
Battles 'occurred on the outer walls of the build- 1g.
Explosions were a common occur- rence.
No insurance company would write @ policy on any organization main- taining offices in the Baxter Building.
Collins also discovered that losing the FF as tenants would not solve his prob- lems.
During a period when the FF had split up
and vacated their headquarters,
Collins discovered that no one would rent the FF's former headquarters.
There was too great a fear that supervillains would attack those floors regardless of who now lived there.
'Then one day Terrax disintegrated everything above the 32nd floor.

She is also acquaint- 24 with the deities of death in other ppantheons,

The three goddesses of fate,

hhave warned the Asgardians gods that Hela will prove a great danger to them 'Odin himself decreed that,
on the day of her maturity,
Hela become the 'goddess
and ruler of the spirits of the 'Asgardian dead.
He reserved for himself the right to rule Valhalla,
where the spirits of courageous war- 'iors who died in battle reside.
Hela was given control of Hel

both realms of the dead.
For 'ages,
Hela has sought to bring more 'Asgardian souls under her contro,
'and especially longs to possess the souls of Odin
and Thor.
In recent years,
Odin's attention wandered from Valhalla.
Hela tried to annex that realm to her own,
hoping to consolidate her power overall the spirits of Asgard's dead.
Eventually,
Odin noticed Hela's trespass
and forced her to withdraw.

The Guidebook line

etc,
) plus adventures for those groups in large-scale source-book formats.
All of the above products are compatible with the Marvel Super Heroes Advanced set,
though only the MA series is designed specifically for the Advanced Set.
This.
'means there is a wealth of information available for the starting Judge to use.
In running a prepackaged adventure,
feel free to manipulate it as you like to fit the playing styles,
character abilities,

and Capabilities of your players.
An adventure such as Murderworid
(MH-3),
designed with the Fantastic Four in mind,
can be modified to fit your own group of heroes in Omaha with a minimum of fuss.
The basic plot Cutline,
for those who missed it,
was that "a 'mysterious someone" hires Arcade,
the 'master assassin,
to put the heroes on ice,
while that "someone" breaks into the hero's HQ —there are a few more twists,
but that is the gist.
In addition,
the adventures in the MA books are created to bbe specific to a particular type of group
(mutants,
heroes banded together as 'Avengers,
etc.
) but not to any particular heroes,
When creating your own adventures,
keep in mind that an adventure is basically a string of encounters
(combat or otherwise) 'organized around a common theme.
An adventure should have the potential for resolution in the space of a few gaming sessions,
with a definite resolution.
'An Encounter is made up of three parts: a Problem,
a Conflict,

and a Resolution.
'The problem is the "hook" that brings the players into the Encounter,

and likely 'arfies the adventure to the next encounter 'as well.
A problem can be made known to the hero through a number of means,
Heroes can be in the area of a disturbance,


'This applies to vertical
and horizontal turns,

and includes pulling out of a dive atthe last 'moment,
turning alongside buildings,

and skimming close to surfaces.
Low Altitude Flight: I a hero is flying at relatively low altitudes
(less than 2 stories up) oF in close quarters
(inside or 'surrounded by tall buildings),
the maximum 'speed in flight is equal to the speed the hhero can move on the ground with that Power rank
(that is,
ground speed).
Storm,
for example,
moves 20 areas per turn by the air I in a closed space
(such as inside {an office) or close to the ground,
her 'maximum speed would be 7 areas per round.
The hero may exceed that speed,
up to his or her maximum air speed,
but all actions in that range
(between 7
and 20,
'areas per turn for Storm) require Agility FEATS to perform.
Gliding: Gliding is a special form of flying using Powers or equipment
(such as ppara-glides,
parachutes that permit some limited control).
A character that glides 'drops 1 floor for every round in the air,
but moves the number of areas stated per round.

(If no numberof areas is stated,
then the movement is Typical — 6 areas per round).
A character who is gliding may also travel as fast as the wind speed 'Swimming
and Water Movement Unless otherwise stated,
assume that most heroes can swim.
Swimming,
however,
is 'slow,
a maximum of one area per round,
unless other Powers increase that rate.
'Those heroes who can fly at their Power rank speeds use the Water column for that speed,
with a maximum of 9 areas per round
(Monstrous).
'Surface movement is similar to land 'movement,
except the heroes or vehicles involved must float
(hat is,
must keep the water from getting inside the boat),
'As an aside,
here is a good place to 'mention drowning.
Characters can hold their breath a number of rounds equal to their Endurance rank number.
At this point,
they must make a green Endurance FEAT.
'The next round,
they must make a yellow Endurance FEAT.
In each following round,
they must make a red Endurance FEAT or start drowning.
Drowning results in tunconsciousness,

and loss of one Endurance rank per round.
When Endurance reaches 0 the character dies.
Long Distance Movement Long distance movement applies to both

'or Body Armor,
but two or more individuals striking at the same spot may be able to affect the foe.
As with combined material Strength FEATS,
the two must inflict damage within 10 points of each other.
The higher total is raised to the next rank of damage,
at the lowest point
(88 for Unearthiy,
etc.
) providing the individual with the lower damage ability makes an Agility FEAT
(the one with the higher FEAT must 'score a normal hit).
This applies to Slugfest,
'Charging,

and Energy
and Force Powers.
Double-Teaming: A form of combined attack 'where one attacker holds the target
and the 'other hits him.
The first attacker must get a Hold or Partial Hold on the target.
The second attacker then gets a + 1CS on attacks
(but a miss on the target may hit the Grappling attacker — make a second roll as if attacking that characte Fastball Special: A special form of Charging attack developed by Messrs.

The attack uses the thrower's 'Aiity to ht,

Damage is done by the thrown character as determined by Endurance,

) 'Shockwave: A version of the Groundstr Used by those with Edged or Blunt Slugfest attacks.
The attacker must have a Strength at least two ranks higher than the material he is standing on; he then strikes at the 'ground with fists,

setting up a 'shockwave that will ravel up to 2 areas 'away in any direction.
Those in the path of the Shockwave are attacked by as if by a 'Charge of the attacker's Strength.
No 'damage is done by a Shockwave attack
(though incidental damage may be inflicted by damaged buildings,
bridges falling down,
etc.
) but targets may be stunned or slammed if these results ae rolled,

A Blindsiding attack gains a +2C8 to hit,

and the character hit by a Biindsiding attack may not add Karma to any die ros to determine if the attack 'Slams,
Stuns,
or Kills.
The Judge has final 'say on Blindsiding,
but guidelines are: i the 'character is taken unaware from behind,


'SUMMARY: The Olympians chase the heroes from Olympus,
'STARTING: Use this encounter when 'Actus orders the Olympians to capture the heroes in Chapter 6,
or under any ther circumstance where the heroes 'must flee Olympus.
I the heroes are 'ot fleeing from the Hall of Zeus,
it 'may be necessary to adjust the open- ing of the encounter to the particular circumstances of your adventure,

a set resolution is entertaining,
but the 'Judge may want to spice things up with Random Encounters aimed specifically at the heroes.
MHAC-6,
New York,
New York,
provides one method of generating random events
and presents a large number of suggested encounters.
These are small 'one-shot" adventures that should take up fan evening of play or less,

and may deter the characters from moving too quickly through the main adventure you have planned.
New York,
New York concentrates on urban encounters,
mostly combat situations.
A 'more free-form method of encounters is to Create a group of small one-shot Ncounters to throw at the heroes,
alone or in groups,
to keep them occupied
and provide a good way of gaining Karma without fighting Galactus.
You,
the Judge,
'can create a number of these for your heroes,
as a list,
similar to the ones below.
When you feel you need a random 'encounter
(say,
atthe start of the game,
or when the hero is heading home for the 'evening,
or trying to get across town for an important appointment) roll a ten-sided die,
look down thelist,

and run that encounter the next time the hero or heroes are in a situation to which it applies
(for example,
as Power Outage is better at night,
when itis rolled,
wait until dark to spring it).
Only one random event should be in operation at a time.
Here are some examples.
1) The Robbery: The hero isin the vienty 'ofa stor
(pick one) when the alarm goes 'Three thugs come out ofthe store,
guns Blazing,
holding bags of lot.
They run to the end ofthe block,
where a fourth man is waiting with a car,

The Car wil head forthe farthest edge ofthe 'map,
andi it makes it the tral willbe lost 2) The Contact: The hero gets a note from 'one of his Contacts to see him.
This can be a springboard for another adventure,
as the Contact may have some mystery to present to the hero,
or disappear himself before the hero can reach him,
3) Burglary: Its night
and a burglar alarm siren goes off down the street.

Of that character's Powers is such that the character could hover in place.

(Storm,
for example,
gains her fight Powers by contol of winds,

and as such may hover,
while Cannonball,
who has his Powers by chemical reaction,
may not hover in place.
) Landing: A character landing after moving at high speed may have difficulties.
Those 'moving at more than 3 areas per round 'must make an Agility FEAT,
with failure \dicating a Slam result
(see Charging).
Those heroes who can hover in place,
or reduce themselves to 0 speed,
do not have to worry about landing,
Altitude: Each floor or height is considered {an area for purposes of movement.
fa 'character moves forward three areas
and Lp two floors,
a total of five areas ar considered to be moved.
Similarly,
a character that moves two areas forward
and four floors down has moved six areas.
Diving Option: When gaining height you 'move more slowly,

and when descending you pick up speed.
The above rule for 'Atitude reflects the loss in speed,
but at the 'Judge's option,
the players may use the following for Diving.
For each three floors in height reduced,
the hero's speed is increased by one area.
Example: Angel is moving at 6 areas per round.
He charges
(dives) forthe full six areas.
Angel now can ove an additional two areas,
either 'downward or horizontally.

(A character who dives 9 areas may use the additional three areas to continue diving,
gaining another area,
for 18 total.
) Diving may be used in Charging combat.
Pulling out of a dive requires an Agilty FEAT.
Obstructions: With normal ground 'movernent,
itis assumed that the characters can open doors
and the ike.
Such actions are not available to flying characters.
I a door or window is closed,
the character has the choice of stopping to 'open it,
or going through it.
The same applies to walls.
'Turns: Any turn of up to 90 degrees by a flying character counts as moving into an area.
For example,
if a character moves {rom area A to adjacent area B,
then turns to area C,
he has moved 3 areas
(move to B,
turn,

and move to C).
This applies to both ranged
and area movement.
Ha character attempts a turn of 90 degrees 'or more,
she must make an Agility FEAT roll.
Failure indicates thatthe individual did 'not overcome the forward momentum of the flight
and continues in the original direction.


round may do so with the note that the actions may require a larger FEAT than previously.
'A character may perform up to three non-combat actions in a round,
or one 'combat action
and one non-combat action
(or multiple combat operations,
check under the Combat section).
The difficulty of the FEATS is ralsed,
however.
It both actions are Automatic,
they both 'may be performed in a single round without either FEAT being increased.
It the tougher action requires a green FEAT,
then both actions will require yellow FEATS to succeed.
It the tougher action requi then both actions will succeed.
lithe tougher action requires a red FEAT then both actions may not be performed in the same round
(or rather,
both will fai).
Movement Previously,
we have kept movement
and distances relatively simple.
The main playing area or map has been divided into areas,
which limit movement.
These areas have varied in size according to the space available,

and a hero would move through two large areas at the same rate as two 'small areas.
In the MARVEL SUPER HEROES 'Advanced Set,
we retain that idea of areas for normal movement on the map.
In addition,
we provide the option of ranged movement,
for use with or without the maps Provided.
'Area Movement 'Area movement is for use on the maps [provided with this product
and other MARVEL SUPER HEROES products,
or 'maps created by the Judge using areas.
'Areas are defined by dotted lines on the 'maps,

and also by the edges of buildings 'and changes in elevation.
An area of open 'space is about 44 yards.
Enclosed spaces,
walls,
trees,

and shrubs may reduce the size of an area,
'A character's Endurance normally determines the number of areas he can 'move through in a turn.
'© Those characters with a current Endurance of Feeble may only move 'one area per turn

in Endurance,
all FEATs performed by that individual drop by one rank as well
(a 'wo-rank Endurance loss results in 20S on all FEATS).
Ifthe characteris still alive at the end of 1-10 months,
he or she will make 2 {ull recovery in 1-10 weeks.
Player characters also have a Typical chance of catching a major disease
(roll against Endurance).
Holding Your Breath.
In a great number of situations,
such as underwater,
in space,
or ina gas-fled room,
the hero holding his or her breath is a good idea.
Ths is obviously 'an Endurance FEAT,
but how is it handled? Based on what we know about automatic.
'and impossible FEATS,
here is what we 'come up with: '* Each round a character holds his or her breath,
make an Endurance FEAT.
Failure indicates the hero must breathe in the next round or pass out for 1-10 rounds
(during which normal breathing will take place,
if possible).
'+ Take the number of rounds the hero has been holding his or her breath as a rank number.
The Intensity of the required FEAT is that Rank.

(Holding 'your breath for 8 rounds is a Good Intensity FEAT.
) '+ More than three ranks below the hero's Endurance in Intensity is an Automatic FEAT.

(A character with Remarkable Endurance can hold her breath for 4 rounds without any sweat.
) 'From one to three ranks below the Hero's Endurance requires a green FEAT.
* Intensity equal to the Endurance requires a yellow FEAT.
* Intensity one rank greater requires a red FEAT.
* Ifthe Intensity is more than one rank 'greater it is an Impossible FEAT.
If the hero has been holding her breath this long,
she will automatically have to breathe or suffer the consequences.

(In 'our Remarkable example,
this is 46 rounds,
about 4-1/2 minutes.
) Note that sudden exposure to vacuum or 'submergence allows the hero to hold his or her breath,
but being blindsided by a gas attack does not until the hero has resisted Drowning: A character that cannot breathe tunder water
and can no longer hold his or her breath starts to drown.
Drowning involves unconsciousness
and loss of one Endurance Rank per round until Shift 0 is reached
and the character dies.
Characters rescued from the water in that time after

'material strength of an object.
Since that 'makes more sense than "'damage resistance intensity,
" we will use it here.
To break through,
rip up,
or generally damage a material,
a character must make a Strength FEAT against that material strength.
Success indicates a two-lootwide hole,
maximum,
carved in the side.
The material strength of the material determines the result needed for a successful FEAT
(green,
yellow,
or red).
'The listed values are for materials between two inches
and 12 inches thick.
Ifthe 'materia is less than 2" thick,
lower the 'material strength by one rani.
Ifthe terial is between 1
and 2 feet thick,
raise the material strength by one rank.
Wf the 'material strength is over 2 feet thick,
raise the material strength by 2 ranks for purposes of determining damage.
Example: le is listed as Typical material 'One inch of ice is a Poor material.
Two feet Of ice is a Good material.
Three feet or 'more is an Excellent material.
Note that this is an indication of resistance against damage from blows,
not against 'other types of damage
(see Fire
and Ice in the Judge's Book) Power FEATs Power FEATS are similar to Abilty FEATS,
save thatthe player uses the Power instead of the Abily to pul off the FEAT.
Powers
and their 'uses are listed in the back ofthe book For example,
Wall-crawling is a Power,
'whether by molecular charge suppression
(Spider-Man),
suction cups
(the late Fly),
or microscopic molecular hooks
(Nightcrawier),

and has a Power rank.

BACKGROUND: Ben Grimm was born in poverty in New York's Lower East Side.
alcoholic father,
Daniel Grimm,
was chronically unemployed.
What money the family did have came from Ben's older brother's criminal activities.
Daniel J was leader of the Yancy Street Gang until his death in a gang war when Ben was eight.
Ben decided it was now his turn to care for the family
and joined the gang; fhe eventually became its leader.
His later rejection of the Yancy Street Gang led to 2 long-standing grudge against him,
but the gang's current members,
despite many pranks,
have come to Ben's aid when he really needs it.
After his parents died,
Ben was entrusted to his uncle.
Dr.
Jacob Grimm had lifted himself from the ghetto to become a successful physi cian.
While Ben initaly resented his Uncle's success,
he learned love trom him in is frst warm family relationship.
Ben was a football star
and earned an athletic scholarship to Empire State University.
His freshman roommate was a young Reed Richards.
That was the start of a long-lasting friendship that forever altered Ben's life.
Even then Reed had planned on building a starship: Ben jokingly promised to pila it for him.
'After graduation,
Ben joined the U.
S.
Force
and became a test pilot.
When Reed told him he had finally built his starship,
Ben upheld his old promise.
He even agreed to take along Reed's girlfriend
and her brother.

if the Abilty rank is greater than the Intensity rank,
then a green FEAT is needed.
Option: if unstated,
the Judge may deciare the Intensity to be Typical.
'A summary of FEAT Intensities is provided in the Judge's Book.
There are items with variable Intensity levels,
such as poisons 'and gases.
That information
and the effects 'of these items are covered under their own 'sections in the Judge's Book.
'Automatic FEATS: Certain actions can be assumed to be automatically successful.
Picking up a normal chairs a simple act,

and 'would not require a FEAT roll to determine its success.
Picking up a chair while dodging bullets
and defusing a bomb simultaneously will require a FEAT rol.

if an item is more than three ranks lower in Intensity than the requisite Abilty the FEAT can be considered 'automatic,
with the Judge's permission.
The sole purpose for Automatic FEATS isto Prevent the game from being dominated by 'ie rolls.
The Judge always has the power to ask for FEAT rolls.
In some cases,
items lke Poisons may require FEATS regardless of the Intensity.
Impossible FEATs:
(Optional Rule) As a

any action more than one rank 'above the ability may be considered impossible.
The Resource FEAT is always limited inthis fashion

A shift to the lett,

Column Shits are primarily involved as per specific situations
(trying to lift 'an object on a slippery incine may result in a shift of ~1 or =2CS).
Those involved in 'combat are discussed in the combat section 'Shifting of ranks may make certain FEATS 'automatic

Types of FEATS Il Now that we've looked at the mect 'making FEATS,
let's look atthe specific types we talked about briefly above: Ability FEATS,
Power FEATS,
Talent FEATS,
Popularity FEATS
and Resource FEATS.

'Wall-crawling Power rank is used to determine FEATs when using that Power

for example).

Some are stated as "touch" or only operating over a sven distance.
Those that are not 'Specifically stated as having a particular 1nge use the Power Rank to determine their range from the table below: Power Rank Range Table Power Rank Range in Areas Shift 'Touch only Feeble 'Touch only Poor Yarea Typical 2areas Good 'areas Excollent 6 areas Remarkable Bareas Incredible 11 areas 'Amazing 20 areas Monstrous 40 areas,

'There are some cases when a hero may use a Power in a way it was not originally intended to carry out a certain task.
These are known as Power Stunts.
For example,
a character with the Speed Power suddenly decides to run in acircle 'very fast,
creating a whirlwind.
Or a character with Leaping Power decides to se his powerful leg muscles to disrupt the 'ground,
knocking over an opponent.
Or our 'example above,
the wall-crawler decides to se his stick-to-i-ness to grapple a thief.
'These are Power Stunts,
Certain Powers,
'such as weather elemental controls,
almost 'entirely consist of these stunts.

Initiative Modifier: Each side adds to its initiative roll a modifier based upon the highest Intuition on that side.
This may allow a side with a low roll to gain initiative.

Negating Actions: Losing the initiative may negate certain actions.

For example,

you do not get a chance to take your action The FEAT Roll Revisited Long-time players of the MARVEL SUPER HEROES Original game should be very familiar with the concept of FEAT rolls.
The 'success of any action is determined by a FEAT roll.
Quickly summarizing,
you make 'a FEAT rollin the following fashion: 41) Determine the Ability,
Power,
or Talent you are checking.
2) Find out the rank of that Ability,
Power,

(Talent.
3) Roll percentile dice.

" Each "leg" of the move represents a straight line from one point to another,
as well as moving through doors
(or windows or walls,
for that matter) Thinking of the "legs" of a movement as the shots taken on a golf course gives an idea of how it works.

use) Judging Combat 'The greatest amount of judging involves cconflct,
in particular with the player-characters on one side
and the 'Judge-controlled NPCs on the other.
The basic format for batting is laid out in the Players' Book,
but bears repeating here: 1) The Judge determines actions.
2) The Players determine
and state actions.
3) Initiative is rolled.
4) Pre-Action rolls are made.
5) Actions ofthe side that has initiative are made
and resolved.
6) Actions ofthe side that lost initaive are made
and resolved.
When the Judge determines the actions of the characters he controls,
he is effectively role-playing those characters.
As such,
the 'Judge's actions are limited to what those characters may know or see.
The Judge may know that Spider-Man is hanging directly above the head crook inthe shadows ofthe warehouse,
but since the head crook does not know this,
sid crook ould not act on this knowledge until the player running Spider-Man does something {o bring attention to himselt.
'The Judge mentally commits to his action before asking the players what their 'characters are doing.
The Judge can write down the actions if he wishes,
either as a reminder of special actions the characters 'should perform or to keep track of character 'actions in long,
mult-character battles.
The 'Judge should not change his mind after 'committing,
even if the Players pull some tick that destroys the villain's plans.
The 'simple fact is that the Judge holds most of the cards,

and has a large supply of bad 'guys,
challenges,

and troubles with which '0 beseige the heroes.
'There will be situations where the players may grab initiative
and likely negate or foil the bad guys' actions.
In this case,
the 'Judge may check to change actions in the Pre-action section of the turn,
Such changes are always Agility FEATS,
with the limitations as for player-characters noted on page 14 of the Players' Book.
Any change of actions requires a yellow FEAT,

and any 'actions in that remaining turn are at ~ 1CS,

Multiple 'ports require an Endurance FEAT,

Most individuals with teleportation abiity can teleport their entire bodies

Carrying others when teleporting results in dangers for both the carier

Carying others is considered a Power Stunt,

and may be gained in that fashion.
Unt the Power Stunts mastered,

Leaps of up to the stated distance are possible by a green Strength FEAT
(those of half the listed values may be assumed 'utomatic).
Leaps across one additional 'area may be made by a red Strength FEAT.
Leaps down are effectively a controlled fal,
'and represent the maximum distance the hhero can fall

'The Current Story.
As Galactus entered the godly dimensions,
his personality shattered into three sepa- rate pieces
(a result of the Cube's directive to destroy him).
Galactus' memories went to Muspelheim,
his intellect went to Olympus,

and his desires went 0 Hel In Olympus,
Ac challenged
and defeated Zeus in personal combat After banishing the former ruler of Olympus to Hades,
Ac took time to reflect on his situation.
Lacking both memory
and desire,
he rationally deduced that his purpose in life must be to conquer the god! Therefore,
he immer doing so,
conquering Heliopolis fst.
In Hel,
Tus met
and courted Hela,
queen of Hel
and Niffleheim.
Hel enjoyed Tus' attentions
and took him as a lover.
It was not long,
however,
before Tus began to sense the need to feed,

and left Hel to find a suitable food supply.
In Muspeiheim,
Gal was tormented by the memories ofall the destruc: tion
and sutfering Galactus had caused.
Unfortunately for him,
he did not have the intelligence to un: stand the cosmic necessity of Galac- tus' destructive feeding.
He attempted to retreat into a catatonic shell,
ut the fire demons soon found him.
They made the mistake of taunt ing him,
which completely unbal- anced Gal.
He rose
and conquered the entie dimension in short order.
'This isthe situation when Uatu the Watcher summons the heroes,
The heroes must discover what has hap- pened to Galactus,

and at the same time prevent Ac from sacking Asgard.
The task will not be an easy

Types of FEATS The following are the different types of FEATS called for in the course of the game.
Ability FEATS are those that rely on one of the seven primary abilities
(Fighting,
Agility,
Strength,
Endurance,
Reason,
Intuition,

and Psyche).
These FEATS 'may be raised or lowered by Talents or the existing situation Power FEATS are those that rely on 'one the hero's individual Powers: a character with Water Control of 'Amazing checks on the Amazing 'column to determine success.
Talent FEATS are those that rely on the hero's Talents,
where the Talent 'modifies a specific ability for FEATS.
Popularity FEATS are those used in social interaction,

and use the Popularity rank,

and may be modified by Contacts,
Resource FEATS are used in Connection with the character Resource rank,

and determine if the character can afford a specific item or piece of equipment.
Think of this as a "Credit Check,

Time Scale — The Turn 'The MARVEL SUPER HEROES game is played in turns,
also called rounds.
Each turn is six seconds of "real" time
(about the 'amount of time that takes place in a panel 'of a comic story).
There are therefore ten turns to @ minute,

and 600 turns to an hour 'Tums are only important when time is a crucial factor,
such as situations where the hero must find a bomb before it explodes,
cchase down a suspect,
or battle with an 'opponent.
Most of the time,
the Judge will 'not have the players run through periods of iting.
I the heroes decide to wait ten 'minutes for a bus,

those Powers.
As Judge,
you monitor that door,

and the types of stunts you permit in 'your campaign wil in part set the tone of your campaign.
The kind of campaign you assemble depends completely on your Nature
and that of your players.
Power stunts should not be forced on the players by the Judge; rather,
they should be 'generated by players coming up with Unique answers to dangerous situations,
or 'experimenting with their Powers on their own,
'The player comes up with a Power stunt,
Oks it with the Judge,
spends the Karma {and tries the stunt.
Tp question then is,
how do you as the Jilige determine if a Power stunt is possible? 'A number of listed Powers have possible Power stunts listed as potential abilities Using that Power.
These are only possible stunts using these Powers,

and are not "automatic" Power stunts for anyone who gains these Powers.
The listed Power Stunts are options available to characters with those Powers.
Players running pre-generated characters with a history in the Marvel Universe can find a listing of thei most common Power stunts under those Powers.
They are not limited to those stunts alone,

and often in their appearances in the Marvel Universe 'exhibit other stunts that they may perform.
'Asa general guideline,
if a pre-generated hero has performed a Power stunt at least 'twice in his own book,
it indicates a true manifestation of that Power stunt
(as 'opposed to one totally due to circumstance
(F outside influences),

and may be attempted by player characters.
The type of FEAT result needed
(green,
yellow,
or red) is determined as noted on page 17 of the Players' Book.
'But what about situations outside those 'suggested for various random Powers or <delailed in characters listings or their 'adventures? At this point,
the Judge earns,
hiis keep
and his name: he makes a judgment on whether the FEAT is possible.
This decision should be based upon the situation
and what the player is trying to have his hero do.
As a general ule,
the effects of a Power stunt should never be of 'greater effect than the Power itis derived from,

and will usually be of one rank lower than the Power itis derived from.
The 'Judge must ask the question,
is what the Player asking reasonable?

Running the Bad Guys 'As Judge,
you are responsible for running all the non-player-characters in the 'campaign,
all the individuals not directly 'controlled by the players.
Of these individuals,
the most interes certainly the most deadly) are the villains.

In addition,
airless space has the effect of Monstrous cold,
though any kind of Force Field negates that effect on those within.
See under Judging Combat in Space
and Zero-Gravity.
Contacts
and Resources General Resource ranks are listed in the Power Rosters as a guidepost for character abilities.
in addition,
characters may have 'access to additional Resources through 'The type of aid a Contact can provid depends entirely on the situation,
the Contact,

and the kind of aid requested.
The types of aid are: Services: Services include things like a pilot flying the characters somewhere,
the doctor providing emergency surgery at the drop of a forcep,
or a newsman showing up to cover a super-market opening.
Services inthe line of the NPC's profession are in the targets' best interest,

and as such gain a +2CS for response from Contacts.
Example: The Avengers need a doctor to iagnose Sub-Mariner's fainting spells.
Jarvis has a Doctor as a Contact,

He needs a green FEAT since ths is 'a Contact.
The fainting spells are a result of the flu that's going around,

and Subby 'should be allright provided he rests
and 'gets plenty of fluids.
Information: One of the invaluable sources
(f data for the heroes is their Contacts,
whether they are in the papers,

Ranged Weapons — Unintended Targets: 'A missile weapon that misses its intended target does not generally evaporate,
but Continues on its intended course to the limits of ts range.
Similarly,
if a hero or villain fires into a melee,
missing one target does not guarantee missing other targets.
For this reason,
the Judge may use the Unintended Target rules.
'When firing into a melee
(group of characters fighting,
grappling,
or in close Contact with each other),
if a ranged attack 'misses the original target,
the Judge should ccheck other adjacent targets for a hit.
The check may be made in any order available for adjacent characters,
but any potential targets among those Friendly to the firer should come first,

and then others.
These rolls are made at ~2CS to hit
(as the original fier was not alming at them).
Example: Spider-Man is engaged in resting combat with three goons
and the Fabulous Frog-Man,
an "ally" of the web-slinger.

The shot misses.
The Judge then checks for 'ne of the goons the order is upto the Judge — whoever is closest to the fourth 'goon,

'Similarly,

so that if such a Power or missile leaves the area of play without hitting anything,
