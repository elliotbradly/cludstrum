## A Synopsis of Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998)

Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998) is a landmark work in narratology, applying the philosophical theory of possible worlds to the analysis of literary texts. Doležel doesn’t simply *apply* the theory; he significantly refines and adapts it to address the specific complexities of narrative, moving beyond purely logical frameworks to account for the aesthetic and experiential dimensions of reading. This synopsis will outline the core tenets of Doležel’s argument, its key concepts, its methodology, and its implications for understanding how literature creates meaning.

**The Foundation: Philosophical Possible Worlds Theory**

Doležel begins by grounding his analysis in the philosophical work of Saul Kripke and others who developed the concept of possible worlds. This theory posits that our actual world is just one among an infinite number of logically possible worlds. Each possible world is a complete and consistent way things *could* have been. These worlds aren’t physically real, but they are logically coherent and can be used to analyze concepts like necessity, possibility, and counterfactuals.  For example, a possible world exists where you chose a different career path, or where dinosaurs never went extinct. 

However, Doležel quickly identifies limitations in directly applying this philosophical framework to literature. Philosophical possible worlds are defined by total consistency – every proposition must be either true or false within a given world. Literary worlds, however, are often characterized by inconsistencies, ambiguities, and gaps.  A direct application would render many literary texts logically invalid.

**The Literary Possible World: A Modified Framework**

Doležel proposes a modified version of possible worlds theory tailored to the unique characteristics of narrative. He introduces the concept of the **textual possible world (TPW)**, which is not a fully specified, logically complete world like those in philosophical theory. Instead, the TPW is constructed *gradually* by the reader during the act of reading, based on the information provided by the text. 

Crucially, the TPW is not simply a mental construct of the reader, nor is it solely determined by the text. It’s a dynamic interaction between the two. The text provides the “coordinates” – the information, descriptions, and events – that guide the reader’s construction of the world, but the reader fills in the gaps, makes inferences, and resolves ambiguities. 

This construction happens through a process Doležel calls **world-building**.  The text doesn’t present a pre-existing world; it provides the *materials* for the reader to build one.  This process is not uniform; different readers may construct slightly different TPWs based on their individual experiences and interpretations.

**Key Concepts: D-Values and P-Values**

To analyze the structure of the TPW, Doležel introduces two crucial concepts: **D-values (descriptive values)** and **P-values (propositional values)**.

* **D-values** are the concrete, descriptive elements of the TPW – the characters, settings, objects, and events. They are the “what” of the world.  For example, “Sherlock Holmes lives at 221B Baker Street” is a D-value.
* **P-values** are the propositions that can be asserted about the D-values. They are the “that” of the world.  For example, “Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant detective” is a P-value.

The relationship between D-values and P-values is crucial.  D-values provide the basis for P-values, but P-values are not simply derived from D-values. They involve interpretation and inference.  

Doležel argues that the TPW is structured by a hierarchy of P-values, ranging from those that are explicitly stated in the text (the **textual P-values**) to those that are inferred by the reader (the **non-textual P-values**).  The stability of the TPW depends on the consistency of these P-values.

**The Role of the Narrator and Focalization**

Doležel emphasizes the importance of the narrator in shaping the TPW. The narrator doesn’t simply report events; they select, frame, and interpret them, influencing the reader’s construction of the world.  

He also incorporates the concept of **focalization**, which refers to the perspective through which the story is presented.  The focalizer (the character whose perspective is adopted) filters the information available to the reader, shaping their understanding of the TPW.  A limited focalization creates a more subjective and incomplete TPW, while an omniscient focalization provides a more comprehensive view.

**Types of Possible Worlds & Narrative Strategies**

Doležel identifies different types of possible worlds created in literature, based on their relationship to the actual world:

* **Extension Worlds:** Worlds that are similar to the actual world, with only minor differences.  Realistic fiction often creates extension worlds.
* **Deviation Worlds:** Worlds that deviate significantly from the actual world, often involving fantastical elements or alternative histories. Science fiction and fantasy typically create deviation worlds.
* **Creation Worlds:** Worlds that are radically different from the actual world, often based on entirely new principles and laws.  Some experimental literature creates creation worlds.

He also analyzes how different narrative strategies – such as flashbacks, foreshadowing, and unreliable narration – affect the construction of the TPW.  Unreliable narration, for example, creates a TPW that is deliberately distorted or incomplete, challenging the reader to reconstruct a more accurate version of events.

**Implications for Literary Analysis**

Doležel’s theory has significant implications for literary analysis. It provides a framework for:

* **Understanding Immersion:** By analyzing how the text provides coordinates for world-building, we can understand how literature creates a sense of immersion.
* **Analyzing Narrative Structure:** The hierarchy of P-values reveals the underlying structure of the narrative and how different elements are related.
* **Interpreting Ambiguity and Gaps:**  The theory acknowledges that TPWs are inherently incomplete and that ambiguity is a crucial element of literary experience.
* **Comparing Different Texts:**  The framework allows for a systematic comparison of how different authors construct possible worlds.



**Criticisms and Legacy**

While highly influential, Doležel’s work has also faced criticism. Some argue that the theory is overly abstract and difficult to apply in practice. Others contend that it downplays the role of the reader’s pre-existing knowledge and cultural context.

Despite these criticisms, *Possible Worlds in Literature* remains a foundational text in narratology. It provided a rigorous and sophisticated framework for understanding how literature creates meaning by constructing alternative realities.  It continues to inspire research in areas such as game studies, virtual reality, and cognitive literary studies, solidifying its place as a pivotal contribution to the field.  Doležel’s work moved the study of narrative beyond simply *what* stories tell, to *how* they create the very spaces in which those stories unfold.

## A Comprehensive Synopsis of Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998)

Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998) represents a landmark achievement in narratology, offering a rigorous and nuanced application of philosophical possible worlds theory to the analysis of literary texts. This extended synopsis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Doležel’s argument, delving into its theoretical foundations, key concepts, methodological approach, detailed analyses, and lasting implications for the field of literary studies.  It will explore not only the core tenets of his theory but also the complexities and nuances that distinguish his approach from earlier applications of possible worlds semantics to narrative.

**I. The Philosophical Genesis: Possible Worlds Theory and its Limitations**

Doležel’s project begins with a thorough engagement with the philosophical foundations of possible worlds theory, primarily as developed by Saul Kripke in *Naming and Necessity* (1980). Kripke’s work revolutionized modal logic by proposing that possible worlds are not merely abstract logical constructs but are concrete, complete, and consistent ways things *could* have been. Each possible world is a total state of affairs, where every proposition is either true or false. This framework allows for the analysis of concepts like necessity (what is true in all possible worlds), possibility (what is true in at least one possible world), and counterfactuals (what would have been true if things had been different).

However, Doležel immediately identifies critical limitations in directly applying this philosophical framework to the realm of literary narrative. The core issue lies in the inherent incompleteness and inconsistency often found within literary texts. Philosophical possible worlds demand total consistency – a proposition must have a definite truth value within each world. Literary worlds, conversely, frequently embrace ambiguity, gaps in information, and even logical contradictions. A strict application of Kripkean semantics would render many literary texts logically invalid, failing to account for the aesthetic and experiential dimensions of reading.  For example, the deliberate ambiguity surrounding a character’s motivations, or the presence of supernatural elements defying natural laws, would be problematic within a purely logical framework.

Furthermore, Doležel argues that the philosophical conception of possible worlds is too static and deterministic. It assumes a pre-existing, fully formed world, whereas literary narratives actively *construct* worlds through the process of storytelling. The reader isn’t simply discovering a pre-existing world; they are participating in its creation.

**II. The Textual Possible World (TPW): A Modified Framework for Narrative**

To overcome these limitations, Doležel proposes the concept of the **Textual Possible World (TPW)**. This is not a fully specified, logically complete world in the Kripkean sense. Instead, the TPW is a dynamic and gradually constructed entity, built by the reader during the act of reading, based on the information provided by the text.  It’s a world that emerges through a continuous process of interpretation and inference.

The TPW is not solely a mental construct of the reader, nor is it entirely determined by the text itself. Doležel emphasizes the crucial interplay between the text and the reader. The text provides the “coordinates” – the descriptive elements, events, and relationships – that guide the reader’s construction of the world. However, the reader actively fills in the gaps, resolves ambiguities, and makes inferences based on their own knowledge, experience, and expectations. This interactive process results in a unique TPW for each reader, albeit one constrained by the textual coordinates.

This construction process is not uniform or instantaneous. It unfolds sequentially as the reader progresses through the narrative, constantly revising and refining their understanding of the world.  The TPW is therefore a dynamic entity, evolving with each new piece of information revealed by the text.

**III. D-Values and P-Values: The Building Blocks of the TPW**

To analyze the structure of the TPW, Doležel introduces two fundamental concepts: **D-values (descriptive values)** and **P-values (propositional values)**. These concepts provide a systematic way to dissect the components of the narrative world and understand how they relate to each other.

* **D-values** represent the concrete, descriptive elements of the TPW – the characters, settings, objects, and events. They are the “what” of the world.  Examples include “Elizabeth Bennet is a witty and independent young woman,” “Pemberley is a grand estate in Derbyshire,” or “Mr. Darcy proposes marriage to Elizabeth.” D-values are the raw materials from which the TPW is constructed.
* **P-values** are the propositions that can be asserted about the D-values. They are the “that” of the world.  Examples include “Elizabeth Bennet is intelligent,” “Pemberley is a symbol of wealth and status,” or “Mr. Darcy is initially proud and prejudiced.” P-values are not simply derived from D-values; they involve interpretation, inference, and the application of general knowledge.

The relationship between D-values and P-values is hierarchical. D-values provide the basis for P-values, but P-values are not merely a direct reflection of D-values. They involve a degree of abstraction and generalization.  For instance, observing that Elizabeth Bennet frequently engages in witty banter (a D-value) leads to the P-value that she is intelligent.

Doležel argues that the TPW is structured by a hierarchy of P-values, ranging from those that are explicitly stated in the text (the **textual P-values**) to those that are inferred by the reader (the **non-textual P-values**). Textual P-values are directly supported by textual evidence, while non-textual P-values are based on the reader’s inferences and assumptions. The stability and coherence of the TPW depend on the consistency of these P-values.  Conflicts or contradictions between P-values can create tension, ambiguity, or even undermine the believability of the world.

**IV. The Narrator, Focalization, and the Construction of the TPW**

Doležel emphasizes the crucial role of the narrator in shaping the TPW. The narrator is not simply a neutral reporter of events; they actively select, frame, and interpret them, influencing the reader’s construction of the world. The narrator’s reliability, perspective, and narrative voice all contribute to the shaping of the TPW.

He also incorporates the concept of **focalization**, borrowed from Gérard Genette, which refers to the perspective through which the story is presented. The focalizer (the character whose perspective is adopted) filters the information available to the reader, shaping their understanding of the TPW. A limited focalization creates a more subjective and incomplete TPW, reflecting the focalizer’s limited knowledge and biases. Conversely, an omniscient focalization provides a more comprehensive and objective view of the world.

The choice of focalization significantly impacts the TPW. A narrative told from the perspective of an unreliable narrator will create a TPW that is deliberately distorted or incomplete, challenging the reader to reconstruct a more accurate version of events.  The reader must actively evaluate the narrator’s credibility and fill in the gaps in their account.

**V. Types of Possible Worlds and Narrative Strategies**

Doležel categorizes different types of possible worlds created in literature, based on their degree of deviation from the actual world:

* **Extension Worlds:** These worlds are similar to the actual world, with only minor differences. They often represent alternative scenarios or variations on familiar themes. Realistic fiction frequently creates extension worlds.
* **Deviation Worlds:** These worlds deviate significantly from the actual world, often involving fantastical elements, alternative histories, or violations of natural laws. Science fiction, fantasy, and historical fiction often create deviation worlds.
* **Creation Worlds:** These worlds are radically different from the actual world, based on entirely new principles and laws. They often challenge our fundamental assumptions about reality. Some experimental literature and certain forms of speculative fiction create creation worlds.

Doležel further analyzes how various narrative strategies affect the construction of the TPW. Techniques such as flashbacks, foreshadowing, internal monologue, and stream of consciousness all contribute to the shaping of the world and the reader’s understanding of it.  He demonstrates how these strategies can manipulate the temporal order of events, reveal hidden motivations, and create a sense of suspense or uncertainty.

**VI.  Analyzing Narrative Complexity:  Gaps, Ambiguity, and Contradictions**

A key strength of Doležel’s framework lies in its ability to account for the complexities and inconsistencies often found in literary narratives. He argues that gaps in information, ambiguities, and even logical contradictions are not necessarily flaws in the text but can be deliberate strategies employed by the author to enhance the reader’s engagement and interpretation.

Gaps in information force the reader to actively fill in the missing pieces, constructing their own version of the TPW. Ambiguity allows for multiple interpretations, enriching the meaning of the text. Contradictions can create tension, challenge the reader’s assumptions, and force them to re-evaluate their understanding of the world.

Doležel emphasizes that the TPW is not a static entity but a dynamic and evolving construct. As the reader encounters new information, they must constantly revise and refine their understanding of the world, resolving inconsistencies and filling in gaps. This process of ongoing construction is central to the reading experience.

**VII.  Implications for Literary Analysis and Beyond**

Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* has had a profound impact on the field of literary studies, providing a rigorous and systematic framework for analyzing narrative structure, character development, and the creation of meaning.  It has influenced research in areas such as:

* **Narrative Semantics:**  The study of how meaning is constructed through narrative.
* **Cognitive Literary Studies:**  The application of cognitive science to the study of literature.
* **Game Studies:**  The analysis of video games as narrative systems.
* **Virtual Reality:**  The design and evaluation of immersive virtual environments.

The theory’s emphasis on the dynamic interplay between text and reader has also contributed to a greater understanding of the role of interpretation in the reading process.  It highlights the fact that meaning is not simply inherent in the text but is actively constructed by the reader based on their own knowledge, experience, and expectations.

**VIII.  Criticisms and Ongoing Debates**

Despite its significant contributions, Doležel’s work has also faced criticism. Some scholars argue that the theory is overly abstract and difficult to apply in practice, requiring a level of analytical rigor that can be daunting. Others contend that it downplays the role of the reader’s pre-existing knowledge, cultural context, and emotional responses.  

Furthermore, some critics argue that the focus on logical consistency overlooks the importance of other aesthetic qualities, such as emotional resonance and stylistic innovation.  The emphasis on P-values and D-values, while providing a systematic framework, can sometimes feel reductive, failing to capture the richness and complexity of literary experience.

However, these criticisms have also spurred further research and refinement of the theory.  Contemporary scholars continue to explore the potential of possible worlds theory, adapting it to address new challenges and incorporating insights from other disciplines.  



In conclusion, Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* remains a seminal work in narratology.  Its innovative application of philosophical possible worlds theory to the analysis of literary texts has provided a powerful and enduring framework for understanding how narratives create meaning, construct immersive worlds, and engage the reader in a dynamic process of interpretation.  It continues to inspire and inform research in a wide range of fields, solidifying its place as a cornerstone of contemporary literary theory.

## A Detailed Synopsis of Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998)

Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998) stands as a pivotal work in narratology, offering a sophisticated application of philosophical possible worlds theory to the analysis of literary texts. This synopsis aims to provide a detailed overview of Doležel’s argument, exploring its theoretical foundations, core concepts, methodological approach, and lasting impact on the field. It will delve into the nuances of his framework, highlighting how it addresses the unique challenges posed by narrative and distinguishes itself from earlier applications of possible worlds semantics.

**I. The Philosophical Roots & Limitations of Possible Worlds Theory**

Doležel’s project begins with a thorough engagement with the philosophical groundwork laid by Saul Kripke in *Naming and Necessity* (1980) and other proponents of possible worlds theory. This theory posits that our actual world is merely one among an infinite number of logically possible worlds – complete and consistent states of affairs representing how things *could* have been. Each world is defined by its set of truths; a proposition is either true or false within a given world. This framework allows for the analysis of modality – necessity, possibility, and counterfactuals.

However, Doležel immediately identifies critical limitations when applying this philosophical framework directly to literary narrative. The core issue lies in the inherent incompleteness and potential inconsistency often found within literary texts. Philosophical possible worlds demand total consistency; every proposition must have a definite truth value. Literary worlds, conversely, frequently embrace ambiguity, gaps in information, and even logical contradictions. A strict application of Kripkean semantics would render many literary texts logically invalid, failing to account for the aesthetic and experiential dimensions of reading.  For example, the deliberate ambiguity surrounding a character’s motivations, or the presence of supernatural elements, would be problematic within a purely logical system.

Furthermore, the philosophical conception of possible worlds is largely static, presenting a pre-existing, fully formed reality. Literary narratives, however, actively *construct* worlds through the process of storytelling. The reader isn’t simply discovering a pre-existing world; they are participating in its creation.

**II. Introducing the Textual Possible World (TPW): A Narrative Adaptation**

To overcome these limitations, Doležel proposes the concept of the **Textual Possible World (TPW)**. This is not a fully specified, logically complete world in the Kripkean sense. Instead, the TPW is a dynamic and gradually constructed entity, built by the reader during the act of reading, based on the information provided by the text. It’s a world that emerges through a continuous process of interpretation and inference.

The TPW is not solely a mental construct of the reader, nor is it entirely determined by the text itself. Doležel emphasizes the crucial interplay between the two. The text provides the “coordinates” – the descriptive elements, events, and relationships – that guide the reader’s construction of the world. However, the reader actively fills in the gaps, resolves ambiguities, and makes inferences based on their own knowledge, experience, and expectations. This interactive process results in a unique TPW for each reader, albeit one constrained by the textual coordinates.

This construction process is not uniform or instantaneous. It unfolds sequentially as the reader progresses through the narrative, constantly revising and refining their understanding of the world. The TPW is therefore a dynamic entity, evolving with each new piece of information revealed by the text.  This dynamic nature is crucial; the TPW isn’t a static backdrop but a constantly shifting landscape shaped by the unfolding narrative.

**III. D-Values and P-Values: The Structural Components of the TPW**

To analyze the structure of the TPW, Doležel introduces two fundamental concepts: **D-values (descriptive values)** and **P-values (propositional values)**. These concepts provide a systematic way to dissect the components of the narrative world and understand how they relate to each other.

* **D-values** represent the concrete, descriptive elements of the TPW – the characters, settings, objects, and events. They are the “what” of the world. Examples include “Hamlet is the Prince of Denmark,” “Elsinore Castle is a gloomy and imposing fortress,” or “Claudius murders Hamlet’s father.” D-values are the raw materials from which the TPW is constructed.
* **P-values** are the propositions that can be asserted about the D-values. They are the “that” of the world. Examples include “Hamlet is melancholic,” “Elsinore Castle symbolizes corruption,” or “Claudius is a villain.” P-values are not simply derived from D-values; they involve interpretation, inference, and the application of general knowledge.

The relationship between D-values and P-values is hierarchical. D-values provide the basis for P-values, but P-values are not merely a direct reflection of D-values. They involve a degree of abstraction and generalization. For instance, observing that Hamlet frequently soliloquizes about death (a D-value) leads to the P-value that he is preoccupied with mortality.

Doležel argues that the TPW is structured by a hierarchy of P-values, ranging from those that are explicitly stated in the text (the **textual P-values**) to those that are inferred by the reader (the **non-textual P-values**). Textual P-values are directly supported by textual evidence, while non-textual P-values are based on the reader’s inferences and assumptions. The stability and coherence of the TPW depend on the consistency of these P-values. Conflicts or contradictions between P-values can create tension, ambiguity, or even undermine the believability of the world.

**IV. The Role of Narration and Focalization in Shaping the TPW**

Doležel emphasizes the crucial role of the narrator in shaping the TPW. The narrator is not simply a neutral reporter of events; they actively select, frame, and interpret them, influencing the reader’s construction of the world. The narrator’s reliability, perspective, and narrative voice all contribute to the shaping of the TPW. An unreliable narrator, for example, will create a TPW that is deliberately distorted, challenging the reader to reconstruct a more accurate version of events.

He also incorporates the concept of **focalization**, borrowed from Gérard Genette, which refers to the perspective through which the story is presented. The focalizer (the character whose perspective is adopted) filters the information available to the reader, shaping their understanding of the TPW. A limited focalization creates a more subjective and incomplete TPW, reflecting the focalizer’s limited knowledge and biases. Conversely, an omniscient focalization provides a more comprehensive and objective view of the world.

The choice of focalization significantly impacts the TPW. A narrative told from the perspective of a naive or biased focalizer will create a TPW that is skewed or incomplete, requiring the reader to actively interpret and evaluate the information presented.

**V. Categorizing Possible Worlds & Narrative Strategies**

Doležel categorizes different types of possible worlds created in literature, based on their degree of deviation from the actual world:

* **Extension Worlds:** These worlds are similar to the actual world, with only minor differences. They often represent alternative scenarios or variations on familiar themes. Realistic fiction frequently creates extension worlds.
* **Deviation Worlds:** These worlds deviate significantly from the actual world, often involving fantastical elements, alternative histories, or violations of natural laws. Science fiction and fantasy typically create deviation worlds.
* **Creation Worlds:** These worlds are radically different from the actual world, based on entirely new principles and laws. They often challenge our fundamental assumptions about reality. Some experimental literature and certain forms of speculative fiction create creation worlds.

He further analyzes how various narrative strategies – such as flashbacks, foreshadowing, internal monologue, and stream of consciousness – affect the construction of the TPW. These strategies manipulate the temporal order of events, reveal hidden motivations, and create a sense of suspense or uncertainty, all contributing to the dynamic construction of the world.

**VI.  Addressing Narrative Complexity: Gaps, Ambiguity, and Contradictions**

A key strength of Doležel’s framework lies in its ability to account for the complexities and inconsistencies often found in literary narratives. He argues that gaps in information, ambiguities, and even logical contradictions are not necessarily flaws in the text but can be deliberate strategies employed by the author to enhance the reader’s engagement and interpretation.

Gaps in information force the reader to actively fill in the missing pieces, constructing their own version of the TPW. Ambiguity allows for multiple interpretations, enriching the meaning of the text. Contradictions can create tension, challenge the reader’s assumptions, and force them to re-evaluate their understanding of the world.  Doležel’s framework provides a way to analyze *how* these complexities function within the narrative, rather than dismissing them as errors.

**VII.  Impact and Legacy of *Possible Worlds in Literature***

Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* has had a profound and lasting impact on the field of narratology. It provided a rigorous and systematic framework for analyzing narrative structure, character development, and the creation of meaning. It has influenced research in areas such as cognitive literary studies, game studies, and virtual reality.  

The theory’s emphasis on the dynamic interplay between text and reader has also contributed to a greater understanding of the role of interpretation in the reading process. It highlights the fact that meaning is not simply inherent in the text but is actively constructed by the reader based on their own knowledge, experience, and expectations.  

While the theory has faced criticisms regarding its abstractness and potential for over-analysis, it remains a foundational text for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of how literature creates and sustains believable, immersive worlds.  Doležel’s work moved the study of narrative beyond simply *what* stories tell, to *how* they create the very spaces in which those stories unfold, and how readers actively participate in that creation.

## A Synopsis of Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998)

Lubomír Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998) represents a landmark achievement in narratology, offering a sophisticated application of philosophical possible worlds theory to the analysis of literary texts. This synopsis will provide a detailed overview of Doležel’s argument, exploring its theoretical foundations, core concepts, methodological approach, and lasting impact on the field. It will focus on how Doležel adapts and refines the philosophical framework to account for the unique characteristics of narrative, distinguishing his approach from earlier applications.

**I. The Philosophical Foundation & Its Limitations**

Doležel’s project begins with a thorough engagement with the philosophical work on possible worlds, primarily stemming from Saul Kripke’s *Naming and Necessity* (1980). Kripke’s theory posits that our actual world is just one among an infinite number of logically possible worlds – complete and consistent states of affairs representing how things *could* have been. Each world is defined by its set of truths; a proposition is either true or false within a given world. This framework allows for the analysis of modality – necessity, possibility, and counterfactuals.

However, Doležel immediately identifies critical limitations when applying this philosophical framework directly to literary narrative. The core issue lies in the inherent incompleteness and potential inconsistency often found within literary texts. Philosophical possible worlds demand total consistency; every proposition must have a definite truth value. Literary worlds, conversely, frequently embrace ambiguity, gaps in information, and even logical contradictions. A strict application of Kripkean semantics would render many literary texts logically invalid, failing to account for the aesthetic and experiential dimensions of reading. For example, the deliberate ambiguity surrounding a character’s motivations, or the presence of supernatural elements, would be problematic within a purely logical system.

Furthermore, the philosophical conception of possible worlds is largely static, presenting a pre-existing, fully formed reality. Literary narratives, however, actively *construct* worlds through the process of storytelling. The reader isn’t simply discovering a pre-existing world; they are participating in its creation.

**II. The Textual Possible World (TPW): A Narrative Adaptation**

To overcome these limitations, Doležel proposes the concept of the **Textual Possible World (TPW)**. This is not a fully specified, logically complete world in the Kripkean sense. Instead, the TPW is a dynamic and gradually constructed entity, built by the reader during the act of reading, based on the information provided by the text. It’s a world that emerges through a continuous process of interpretation and inference.

The TPW is not solely a mental construct of the reader, nor is it entirely determined by the text itself. Doležel emphasizes the crucial interplay between the two. The text provides the “coordinates” – the descriptive elements, events, and relationships – that guide the reader’s construction of the world. However, the reader actively fills in the gaps, resolves ambiguities, and makes inferences based on their own knowledge, experience, and expectations. This interactive process results in a unique TPW for each reader, albeit one constrained by the textual coordinates.

This construction process is not uniform or instantaneous. It unfolds sequentially as the reader progresses through the narrative, constantly revising and refining their understanding of the world. The TPW is therefore a dynamic entity, evolving with each new piece of information revealed by the text.

**III. D-Values and P-Values: The Building Blocks of Meaning**

To analyze the structure of the TPW, Doležel introduces two fundamental concepts: **D-values (descriptive values)** and **P-values (propositional values)**. These concepts provide a systematic way to dissect the components of the narrative world and understand how they relate to each other.

* **D-values** represent the concrete, descriptive elements of the TPW – the characters, settings, objects, and events. They are the “what” of the world. Examples include “Hamlet is the Prince of Denmark,” “Elsinore Castle is a gloomy fortress,” or “Ophelia drowns.” D-values are the raw materials from which the TPW is constructed.
* **P-values** are the propositions that can be asserted about the D-values. They are the “that” of the world. Examples include “Hamlet is melancholic,” “Elsinore Castle symbolizes corruption,” or “Ophelia’s death is a tragedy.” P-values are not simply derived from D-values; they involve interpretation, inference, and the application of general knowledge.

The relationship between D-values and P-values is hierarchical. D-values provide the basis for P-values, but P-values are not merely a direct reflection of D-values. They involve a degree of abstraction and generalization. For instance, observing that Hamlet frequently soliloquizes about death (a D-value) leads to the P-value that he is preoccupied with mortality.

Doležel argues that the TPW is structured by a hierarchy of P-values, ranging from those that are explicitly stated in the text (the **textual P-values**) to those that are inferred by the reader (the **non-textual P-values**). Textual P-values are directly supported by textual evidence, while non-textual P-values are based on the reader’s inferences and assumptions. The stability and coherence of the TPW depend on the consistency of these P-values. Conflicts or contradictions between P-values can create tension, ambiguity, or even undermine the believability of the world.

**IV. Narration, Focalization, and the Shaping of Perception**

Doležel emphasizes the crucial role of the narrator in shaping the TPW. The narrator is not simply a neutral reporter of events; they actively select, frame, and interpret them, influencing the reader’s construction of the world. The narrator’s reliability, perspective, and narrative voice all contribute to the shaping of the TPW. An unreliable narrator, for example, will create a TPW that is deliberately distorted, challenging the reader to reconstruct a more accurate version of events.

He also incorporates the concept of **focalization**, borrowed from Gérard Genette, which refers to the perspective through which the story is presented. The focalizer (the character whose perspective is adopted) filters the information available to the reader, shaping their understanding of the TPW. A limited focalization creates a more subjective and incomplete TPW, reflecting the focalizer’s limited knowledge and biases. Conversely, an omniscient focalization provides a more comprehensive and objective view of the world.

The choice of focalization significantly impacts the TPW. A narrative told from the perspective of a naive or biased focalizer will create a TPW that is skewed or incomplete, requiring the reader to actively interpret and evaluate the information presented.

**V. Types of Possible Worlds & Narrative Strategies**

Doležel categorizes different types of possible worlds created in literature, based on their degree of deviation from the actual world:

* **Extension Worlds:** These worlds are similar to the actual world, with only minor differences. They often represent alternative scenarios or variations on familiar themes. Realistic fiction frequently creates extension worlds.
* **Deviation Worlds:** These worlds deviate significantly from the actual world, often involving fantastical elements, alternative histories, or violations of natural laws. Science fiction and fantasy typically create deviation worlds.
* **Creation Worlds:** These worlds are radically different from the actual world, based on entirely new principles and laws. They often challenge our fundamental assumptions about reality. Some experimental literature and certain forms of speculative fiction create creation worlds.

He further analyzes how various narrative strategies – such as flashbacks, foreshadowing, internal monologue, and stream of consciousness – affect the construction of the TPW. These strategies manipulate the temporal order of events, reveal hidden motivations, and create a sense of suspense or uncertainty, all contributing to the dynamic construction of the world.

**VI.  Addressing Narrative Complexity & The Value of Doležel’s Framework**

Doležel’s framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing narrative complexity. It allows for a systematic examination of how authors create believable and immersive worlds, even when those worlds contain inconsistencies or ambiguities.
