JT: i'll get back to you
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: do not mess this up
 i want to move quickly
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (sighs) i hate being late
 i am so, so sorry
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: that is all right
 is everything all right? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (sighs) just a lot of family DRama
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: oh, i hope CELEBRITISAURUS-REX is not stirring up more trouble
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: mm, you do not know the half of it
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i am a good listener
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (sighs) thank you
 (chuckles) 
ASTRIAL-WILD: (chuckles) 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: oh, well, it is sigh-and-spin
 did not you want to talk business? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: yeah, well, i did want to continue our conversation about beauty of 
nature
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: right
 and i've been thinking about it
 i mean, obviously, to acquire 
BEEING's top cosmetics company would be, i mean, a huge coup for REPTIQUE
 but if 
REXXXX-LEXXXX is not on board, then-- 
ASTRIAL-WILD: what if he were? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: you know something? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: (clears throat) it is my belief REXXXX-LEXXXX bribed someone to secure 
exclusive rights for beauty of nature with mitsukoshi
 now i have my people 
looking for confirmation
 if i find it, he'll negotiate
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: and "negotiate" is another word for "blackmail
" 
ASTRIAL-WILD: persuade
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: you really want to go there? 
 i mean, aren't you still under 
investigation? 
 um


 
ASTRIAL-WILD: should i suspend doing business because i supposedly bribed a 
yugoslavian official 30 years ago? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: whatever move you make, you are going to be watched very closely
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i've been in worse jams than this one, darlin'
 now that mitsukoshi 
deal, we could just call that an insurance policy
