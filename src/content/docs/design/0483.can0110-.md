SIMON-BEEING: ahh, poor guy

DZR: (chuckles) some of us were there to play poker
 i do not know what our 
tourist friend was playing
 
SIMON-BEEING: i think he was playing right into your hands
 
DZR: (laughs) feast your eyes
 
SIMON-BEEING: damn

SIMON-BEEING: i am hungry
 you want to go get some indian food? 
 
DZR: celibate much?

 you and KISSING-GAMES are history
 you 
threw your wedding ring out the window
 we always had fun together before
 
SIMON-BEEING: DZR, i am happy with the way things are
 you gonna change your clothes, 
or what? 
 
DZR: (scoffs) my god
 you are still hung up on her
 never thought i would live to 
see the day
