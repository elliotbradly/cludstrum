A Storytelling Game of Beautiful Madness

                                                 What  

   Alec Bourbon  

                                                    Said

    They called the guy Alec Bourbon because he loved to drink, but aside 
from that, he had a strange way about him. It made some people nervous and it 
made some people laugh, but Alec never left anyone around him untouched. 
Whenever he and the regulars who hung around his shithole local heard that Van 
Morrison song on the jukebox, “Jackie Wilson Said,” Alec would change that 
line to “Alec Bourbon Said,” and then he’d follow it up with any bit of doggerel 
that came to mind and howl it to the bar at top volume. Even weirder was that 
people played along — if he said, “Alec Bourbon said thumb your nose,” every 
(other) rummy and souse in the joint would thumb his nose and laugh like it was 
the greatest joke in the world. They’d pound the heavy oak tables in that old bar, 
and for a brief moment, the air wasn’t so heavy with stale smoke or the smell of 
losers.
    The bar was named after some almost-forgotten church, a haunted ruin 
where witches danced as the drunken protagonist stumbled home in an old 
poem. This wasn’t a place where ironic hipsters or slumming socialites went to 
drink beer from cans. This was a place where men who had witnessed hard 
lives went to die slowly, poisoning themselves along the way. It was always winter 
inside, the end of something, cold and melancholy but for the few brief moments 
when something comic happened. Even then, though, that mirth was momentary, 
like the time Old Dom slipped in a pool of spilled beer and fell on his face, 
shoving his glasses into his baggy eyes. The whole place guffawed at Dom’s 
goggled peepers! The surgery left him entirely blind in one eye and mostly 
blind in the other, though. Old Dom owed Alec $20. Alec Bourbon liked it cold 
and dark inside the bar.
    Our man had a face like the bole of a tree and hands like a tree’s gnarled 
roots. His hair, when he didn’t wear that greasy New York Jets cap, looked like a 
crow’s nest of thatch and twigs. Even Alec’s disposition could grow as dark as the 
wooden surfaces of the bar on occasion, especially when women were involved. 
They hated him, and he hated them. Butch, behind the bar, said that Alec 
Bourbon had been married years ago, but that she was a beer woman, so he 
eventually had to kill her. Alec said Butch had a shit sense of humor, to shut the 
fook up and that puns were the lowest form of language. Butch told Alec to pay 
his tab and that was the only time in 37 years that Alec didn’t offer a returning 
remark. It was Alec’s bar anyway, even if he didn’t own it or work there. He was 
there more than anyone else.
    So it was that the mumblesome old regulars who shared Alec’s bar were 
surprised one night when in walked a pretty young woman looking at least a 
---------------------Page 4---------------------

century Alec’s junior and asked for him. She wore a bright green dress. Her eyes were 
wide and dewy, her legs long and strong, and more than a few coarse words passed 
among those hoary men when she arrived.
    “Alec’s in the shitter,” Butch said.
    “I will wait,” she replied. Not “I’ll wait,” but “I will wait.” And so she waited.
    When Alec returned from the bathroom, he carried his glass with him. “Thirsty work!” 
he called to no one in particular, and all those no ones in particular laughed, just like they 
always did, before returning to their own drinks. This time, though, they kept their eyes  
on him.
    He walked back to his bar and sat on his high, wooden stool. The woman, her hands 
clasped before her, approached him. “You are Alec Bourbon.”
    He replied by looking at her, eye-to-eye, and downing his drink in a long gulp.
    “I am Anne —”
    “I know who you are, rabbit,” he cut her off, “and if you want what you want, you have 
to have a drink with me.”
    “I do not drink,” she protested. Short, quiet laughs and vague comments about 
femininity floated through the air from patrons seated at the oak and mahogany recesses of 
the bar’s tables.
    “You do if you wan’ talk to me.” This much was true. Alec rarely received guests at the 
bar, but when he did, they always drank with him, some more willingly than others. Several 
loud young men from Boston once drank with him eagerly. An enormous steelworker who 
came to see him drank reluctantly. “You drink with me, I do as you ask,” Alec said.
    “You do not know what I shall ask,” the woman continued, though she took a seat next 
to him (even though he never stood for her or offered it to her, the cad).
    “I didn’t get to be the man I am today by hiding my head in the bushes!” Alec 
bellowed, slapping his hand on the bar with a sound like a cudgel.
    The woman skittishly agreed. “I assume we drink bourbon?”
    “Bully for you, honey.”
---------------------Page 5---------------------

    After that, no one heard what they said to each other for the rest of the night. The 
woman left, but no one could tell you when, or how many drinks she had or her apparent 
mood when she left. Everyone at the bar just nodded and looked the other way. Butch 
swore he put the woman’s only drink on Alec’s tab. Butch vaguely remembered her 
saying something about a year and a day.
                                    B B B
    Muttering to himself, Alec rode the downtown train. “Promises, promises,” he snarled 
at the world, or maybe to anyone who had the power to do anything about them. That was 
his life, promises and dreams. He imagined that in anyone else’s life, a world of promises 
and dreams would be a beautiful thing. Not so for him. He kept promises because he had 
to. For the same reason, he kept so many dreams at bay.
    At the second stop after the transfer line, the woman with the dewy eyes and long 
legs got on the train. She wore a dour gray dress and a raincoat almost the same color as 
the dress, only a little more blue.
    Alec noticed her but paid her no mind. She saw him, but her eyes betrayed no hint of 
recognition.
    Other people boarded the train, too: teenagers going home late from friends’ houses, 
short-order cooks coming off the mid-shift, lawyers who put in long hours. Alec didn’t know 
any of them. A man in a suit on a cell phone bumped his knee and said, “Sorry, old man.” 
Alec offered a half-hearted reply, “Promises, promises.” The man in the suit gave Alec a 
curious look that expressed a lack of comprehension, but then turned away and returned to 
his cell phone conversation. Alec was obviously senile. Just another nut on the train.
    Alec sat in the same seat for the whole trip, his left hand wrapped around the railing 
like a tree branch that had grown around an intruding fence post. He kept his right hand 
in his pocket, except for the dozen times he brought it out to raise his flask to his lips.
    At the south eight stop, the woman with the dewy eyes and long legs got off the train. 
Alec left the train, too. She went down the stairs and onto the street. Alec followed, 99 steps 
behind her, sipping from his flask. She turned left on Third, left again on Alder and then 
right on Sixth. Alec had gone left on Fifth, left again on Holly and then left onto Sixth.
    Alec wanted her to have enough time.
    When he turned onto Sixth, no one was there. It was too cold to be out long this time 
of year, but that was the way Alec liked it. The bourbon in his flask kept him warm, and he 
smoked a cigarette, clutching it between his fingers, feeling its heat through his cutoff gloves. 
That was probably long enough, he reasoned, and took a few steps down the block.
    The brownstone he lingered in front of was lit up with cold light, only a few of the 
windows displaying any hint of the season’s coming holidays. Presently, a couple dressed 
in running gear came out the front door, walking a pale-eyed Weimaraner. Alec grabbed 
the doorknob before the door closed and pushed his way inside. He found the foyer 
damnably warm.
    D7. Fourth floor. Alec took the stairs.
    As he came to the landing on the fourth floor, Alec checked his jacket. There, inside, 
he felt the length of polished flying rowan he carried with him. It had always done the 
trick in these circumstances. He squinted his eyes and pursed his lips, as if the thought 
pained him; the club always helped him fulfill his promises.
    Alec Bourbon knocked on the door of D7.
---------------------Page 6---------------------

    The dewy-eyed woman answered, though the door was chained. She had changed 
from her workaday dress into a slouchy sweatshirt and jeans. Blue light emanated from the 
room behind her, the television spilling its content, unheeded, awaiting her return.
    For a moment, the woman’s face looked confused. Then a look of recognition washed 
over her features. “Uncle Roy?” she asked.
    “That’s right, my dear,” Alec Bourbon replied. “I’ve brought your birthday present.”
    The woman smiled, elated. She closed the door, and Alec heard the rattle of the 
chain on the other side. Then she opened it again, her arms wide to embrace him. He 
didn’t, but she didn’t act snubbed.
    Wretched apartment. He was doing her a favor. The TV, he saw, was tuned to the 
Mets game (the  Mets , of all games!). A cat hunched over its food and water dishes in the 
kitchenette. Alec could hear the hum of the microwave, could smell the reek of frozen 
food sluggishly thawing and cooking in its heavy sauces.
    “Do you want a beer, Uncle Roy?” the woman asked.
    Alec gritted his bark-textured teeth. “No, dear, I’ve brought my own.” He took out his 
flask and took a deep swig, glancing at her out of the corner of his eye. Then he put his 
flask away, without bothering to offer her any.
    She smiled anyway and took a bottle of diet ginger ale out of the refrigerator. 
Pouring herself a juice glass full of the stuff, she went over to the couch, the television 
grabbing her attention again. “What’s this about a birthday present?” she called over her 
shoulder. “I don’t see anything wrapped.”
    “You have three guesses, dearest. If you can guess what it is, I won’t give it to you.”
    The woman took her eyes away from the TV again and looked at him. “That’s a 
strange gift to give. You won’t give it to me if I guess what it is?”
    “That’s right. Now what’s your first guess?”
    “That doesn’t make any sense,” she said, intrigued by the weird, unconventional nature 
of the present. She hadn’t even planned on celebrating her birthday. No one at the office 
knew today was the day, and she was tired anyway. Maybe she and some of the girls 
could get together this weekend.
    “Just indulge your Uncle Roy, sweetheart.”
    “Is it Mets tickets?” She came over to stand with him in the kitchenette, hoping to gain 
a clue, to see if he held something that might give away some of the surprise.
    Alec Bourbon rolled his eyes. “No, it’s not Mets tickets.”
    “Is it a CD?”
    “No, it’s not a CD. I wouldn’t know what music to get you. All your music sounds like 
racket to me anyway.”
    She laughed as the microwave beep-beep-beeped that it was done. “Is it a collar for 
Robespierre?”
    Robespierre? What the hell kind of name is that for a cat? Alec wondered. “No, it’s 
not that. So now I have to give it to you” He sighed heavily as he drew the length of wood 
from inside his jacket.
    She made a confused face — just as all the women always did — and he swung the 
club at her face with such ferocity that it burst her nose and mouth at once. A spatter of 
blood showered across the linoleum floor and the countertops.
---------------------Page 7---------------------

    The confused look remained on her face, but her eyes bulged with pain and welled 
with tears.
    Alec Bourbon struck her again, and she fell. And then again. And again and again 
and again. She didn’t move, slumping awkwardly against the lower cabinets, her legs 
splayed out at a painful angle and her sweatshirt sopping up some of the spilled blood.
    Alec Bourbon locked the door, chained it and sat down on the threadbare loveseat, 
his head in his hands, unmoving, his tears oozing slowly like sap from a tree’s severed 
limb. “Robespierre, clean up some of that goddamn mess in there, would you?” The cat 
licked its paw twice, then went into the bedroom and curled up on the hamper.
    By the time the game had wound down, Alec Bourbon was drunk as a lord, but he 
still had work to do. He pulled himself up from the loveseat with a suppressed sob and 
returned to the small kitchen to clean up the remains.
    The blood on the floor was gone, but the blood that soaked into the sweatshirt still 
stained it, a crimson blemish. The woman’s body had vanished. In its place sat a rudely 
made corn dolly. In place of the doll’s head, a severed rabbit’s head had been tacked 
to the poppet. The rabbit’s face wore a hideous rictus, and one of its eyes was clouded 
over. Everything smelled of wax and lacquer.
    Alec Bourbon gathered these as quickly as his clumsy stupor would let him 
and stuffed them into a trash bag. Then he put an additional scoop of cat food in 
Robespierre’s bowl. Taking up the bag, he climbed out of the window and clattered 
gracelessly down the fire escape into the alley.
                                   B B B
    “I had a promise to keep, if it’s any of your business, you mop-headed young 
fuckface,” Alec Bourbon told Butch, behind the bar. “I need a constitutional. I’ll have a 
beer and a shot on the side.”
    Everyone at the bar roared. Alec drinking beer! It happened only once or twice a 
year, and he always made a face like an old woman birthing a live snake. He never told 
anybody why he ordered beer once or twice a year, so they respected that, but they 
teased him about it insofar as he’d let them. Old Dom said, “Don’t treat him special. Pour 
him that same piss you pour everyone else.”
    They laughed and sang and somebody played “Jackie Wilson Said,” whereupon 
Alec called out, “Alec Bourbon said, tug your tongue!” and everyone tugged their 
tongues and laughed some more. The bar might have been cold, but everyone’s minds 
and blood were warm.
    “Whatsinna bag?” some loutish young ratso from down the street asked Alec, seeing 
the trash bag at his feet as he sat at his rugged stool.
    “Losing lottery tickets. You want to buy some?” Alec ribbed the kid right back.
    “Naw way, old man,” the kid replied.
    “Good on you,” Alec said.
    Just then, the door opened, and a dewy-eyed woman with long, strong legs walked 
in. She wore a royal blue dress and a bright green wool coat to fend off the outside cold. 
A chill wind blew in through the open door, and everyone in the place wanted to say, 
“Shut that goddamn door!” but everyone also knew not to say anything.
    The woman walked to the bar where Alec sat. He downed his beer and waved 
Butch away.
---------------------Page 8---------------------

    “Seeing you does my heart good, Alec Bourbon. I trust everything came off without 
a hitch?”
    “It did indeed, Anne Timothy.” Despite the woman’s salubrious tone, Alec’s face 
wore no smile.
    “You have my many thanks,” she said, and motioned to Butch to come back over.
Alec was surprised. None of the people not from the bar ever drank with him if they 
didn’t have to. Even those rowdy Boston boys pleaded that they had to get back on the 
road. “You’re going to take a drink with me?” he asked.
“Certainly, I cannot. But I know you gave your word, and a promise fulfilled is a burden 
eased. Even if only temporarily.” Her eyes went to the bag and then to the bartender. 
“Mr. Bourbon will have his namesake,” she called to Butch. “A token of my appreciation.”
By the time Butch returned with the shot, Alec had knocked back the one that still stood 
before him. If he was still surprised, he didn’t show it. He didn’t want her to see what 
made him work. She knew one of his promises. He didn’t want her to guess any more. “I 
suppose you’ll want this, then.” He reached down to the floor and offered her the trash 
bag. It still smelled faintly of wax and lacquer.
“Yes, that is part of the promise, too, I believe.” She smiled. Alec shrugged.
She got up and walked out of the bar without a backward glance. The cold wind blew 
in again, but the door banged shut quickly.
Butch was the first to break the silence. “Shot down, Prince Charming?” Everyone else 
half-laughed nervously.
“Stop your braying, you gap-toothed jackass,” Alec said. “Here, take this bourbon and 
put it above the lintel there. Don’t spill a drop, and leave it there until I ask for it.”
Butch furrowed his brow but complied. “Just leave it here?”
“Just leave it there,” Alec Bourbon confirmed. He wasn’t the only one who had made 
promises. Now he could hold Anne Timothy to one of hers.

                                he rubbed her hand. It had stopped bleeding, but it 
                                 still ached. More like itched. The scratches on her 
                                legs were swelling, too, and every step made her toes 
                              slither together. 
                                Blood was collecting in her sneakers. 
                               She’d been calling out to him for hours. She’d been 
                          yelling his name. She’d followed him into the garden, and 
                         she was planning on really giving him the business because 
                        he knew he wasn’t to be out after dark. But now here she was in 
                           a part of the woods she’d never seen before, all cut up from 
                              the thorns. She’d lost the path an hour ago, and she’d 
                                been calling out his name ever since, calling out. . .
                                      . . .his name. What was his name?
                                      She stopped and shook her head. His name 
                                  was  there, in her brain, and she knew it. She knew 
                                her cat’s name (Penguin) and she knew her employ-
                               ers’ names (Brian and Stella) and she knew their  cat’s 
                             name (Fusi) but what the hell was the kid’s name? 
                              She kept walking, toes still wet from blood, hand 
                     still itching from the scratch. She was walking slower now. 
                        She was confused, having trouble catching her breath or 
                        maybe her thoughts —
                           — and when the face appeared, she nearly screamed. 
                          “Go back!” The face had a head behind it and a body un-
der it, and it looked rather familiar, kind of like the girl who’d drowned last year.
   “Aren’t you dead?” she asked.
   The girl-thing — it didn’t really look like the girl, just from a certain angle — 
shook its head violently. “No time! Go back! The path’s behind you just a few steps!”
   “But I have to find. . . him.”
   The girl-thing shut its eyes tight, as though trying to block out pain. It was silent 
for a long moment. And then it said, “He’s back at home already.”
   She started to protest, but then found she didn’t have the energy. She walked a few 
paces back. Found the path. Went back to the house.
   Later, her employers would ask her why she left Danny —   that was his name! 
— alone for so long. Why she’d gone walking through the rose bushes (because where 
else had those scratches come from?). But all she could think of was the girl-thing, 
and how sad and scared it looked, and why it had been wearing a dog’s collar.
   And why Danny seemed     taller now than he had that morning, and why he didn’t 
know his cat’s name.

                        Funny thing to hate, right? But I do. Ever since I got back, 
                    I’ve hated it. I always think it’s going to be him, my Keeper 
                    or whatever you want to call him. 
                        But I always answer it, because if he comes back, I want 
                    to know about it. So tonight, the phone rings, and the guy 
                    on the other end of the line says, “Look out your window.”

                        “Who the fuck is this?”
                        “You’re going back.”
                        I hang up. I stand there a minute shaking. I was out in 
                    that snow for twenty fucking years  . That bastard gave me

                        “Twenty years, asshole.”
   I hadn’t even realized the phone was ringing, much less that I’d answered it. I 
walk to my room and dig my gun out of my closet. “Who is this?”
   “Give you a hint. I’m like you, except when I got back, I wasn’t stupid enough 
to stand by a window while I’m backlit.”
   “What the fu —”
   Next thing I know, I’m in a goddamn snowdrift. The guy standing over me 
looks a lot like me. I remember him. He was one of the other tenders for that 
bastard’s garden, but he didn’t keep himself warm enough. He’s standing in the 
snow, and I can’t tell where it begins and his legs end. 
   “Told you,” he says. He’s got this weird thing in his hands. It’s a tool that the 
Prince gave him. Strange that I didn’t recognize it right away.
   He raises it over his head, and god damn  if the phone doesn’t start ringing 
right then. Figures.

Members of the Spring Court are quick to organize 
celebrations, from block parties to gallery openings. 
Some become purveyors of alcohol or marijuana (oc-
casionally to minors), letting the relaxed inhibitions 
help people reach for what they want. 
    Spring  courtiers  are  careful  to  recognize  their 
own desires. To do otherwise would be a failure, be-
cause a pleasure unknown is a pleasure unfulfilled. 
Members also try to be aware of what others want, 
especially their comrades-in-arms. Allowing a fellow 
refugee to suffer despair is as much a failure as de-
spairing yourself. A few changelings take it further, 
considering it their duty to ensure their companions 
meet their desires.

                        I run, and one of them fires. I feel the bullet fly past my

                     running I think at the building, You know your part, right?
                        And the building thinks back,   Oh, is it night? Yeah,

   The older cop nods. “I thought it looked like a. . .” He stops. What the hell? It’s 
like a conspiracy. “You get a shot on this sicko, you take it. I’ll back you.” He pats 
his pocket. “He’s armed, you know.”
   The younger cop nods. “I just keep thinking of my little boy. Anybody ever 
did that to him. . .” They walk on. 
   I look down at my hand. I’m holding something that looks like a slender

   Guess I am  carrying something. Where the hell did this come from?

    Roll Results
    Dramatic Failure: The changeling partially trans-
forms into the element for a turn, suffers lethal dam-
age equal to half of his Wyrd points, then reverts to his 
normal form. 
    Failure: The changeling fails to change her form.
    Success: The changeling becomes a living embodi-
ment of the element — a sentient breeze, an animate 
puddle or a living current in a river, a living, self-mo-
bile fire, a small tree or a living, animate statue made of 
wood, stone, metal or glass. 
    The character retains all Mental and Social Attri-
butes and Skills. If she transforms into a solid element, 
for example, a statue of stone, this form has all of her 
physical attributes and Health, but she adds half of her 
Wyrd (round up) to her Strength and gains armor equal 
to half of her Wyrd. This increased Strength does not 
increase the character’s Speed. 
    Characters who transform into air, water, fire or 
other formless elements have no physical characteristics 
but triple the character’s normal Speed. Elemental forms 
capable of damage either do lethal damage equal to half 
of the changeling’s Wyrd (round up) or bashing dam-
age equal to the changeling’s Wyrd, depending upon the 
nature of the element. Fire always does lethal damage, 
while water and electricity always do bashing damage. 
To  attack  in  elemental  form,  the  character  makes  a 
normal attack roll using either Brawl or Weaponry (the 
character’s choice). 
    Taking non-solid form makes the changeling large-
ly immune from harm. If this element form is destroyed 
or seriously damaged (like a fire being extinguished), the 
changeling  automatically  reverts  to  his  normal  form. 
Due to the shock, the changeling also loses two points 
of Willpower and cannot use this clause for one full day.

                                                Supernatural Conflict
          When supernatural entities such as changelings use their powers on one another, the strength of their very 
     nature may help them resist the other’s abilities. Contracts with contested rolls allow the defender to add his Wyrd 
     to the dice pool to resist the Contract. Essentially, the power of the changeling’s inner supernatural nature gives 
     him some added resistance against magical or supernatural powers. Thus, the roll to resist a contested Contract is 
     the appropriate Resistance Attribute + Wyrd. 
          This holds true even when supernatural entities other than changelings clash. If a vampire were to attempt to 
     bend a changeling’s will with its unholy powers of mental domination, the changeling would roll Resolve + Wyrd to 
     resist. The same is true in reverse; if the changeling were to retaliate with the Friendless Tongue Contract (which 
     requires a Composure + Wyrd roll to resist), the vampire would substitute its Blood Potency trait for Wyrd and roll 
     Composure + Blood Potency to resist. 
          Canny changelings should therefore be wary of those other supernatural creatures that stalk the World of 
     Darkness. Though the Lost may be protected by some degree by their Wyrd, they aren’t the only ones who can draw 
     on preternatural reserves of inner strength.

                                       the street like she was waiting for something.

est wishes. Making love with someone she is infatuated with, 
the opportunity to get back at someone who has hurt her, 
the chance to reunite with a loved one who died while they 
were quarreling — most people experience some sort of wish 
fulfillment dream occasionally. The meanings behind those 
dreams are often obvious, but sometimes the wish fulfillment 
is expressed in symbolic terms: dreams of flight may represent 
freedom from a constricting or binding situation, while dreams of 
being pregnant may represent a creative urge unfulfilled.
    Prophetic Dreams: The Wyrd touches all things, running through 
the fabric of dreams as surely as it runs through the furthest mad reaches 
of Arcadia. In the Wyrd, the past and the future merge, and fate looms. 
Therefore, it is no surprise that dreams sometimes contain glimpses of 
the future. Some oneiromancers believe that many dreams are prophetic, 
reflecting the future in the same way that many divination methods do: as 
something that absolutely will occur if events continue based on the exact 
moment in time when the divinatory process is used. Of course, free will is 
the biggest source of those changes in events, and so they are hints at 
best. Still, prophetic dreams are quite common among those touched by 
the Wyrd, and many changelings experience them. 
    While in a dream, a changeling who suspects his environs to be prophetic 
may make a Wits + Occult + Wyrd roll with a bonus equal to the Intensity of 
the roll. Success indicates whether or not the dream itself is indeed prophetic, but 
provides no other information about it. An exceptional success indicates not only 
whether the dream is prophetic but also gives an indication to the changeling 
of how a prophetic dream might be both avoided and assured to occur. If a 
changeling makes any changes whatsoever to the dream through the use of 
oneiromancy, the dream ceases to actually function as a prophetic dream. 
Many oneiromancers consider it terribly unlucky to alter genuinely pro-
phetic dreams.
    A dreamer who experiences a prophetic dream and then later sees 
that prediction come true may regain a point of Willpower. Such mo-
ments infuse the dreamer’s sense of self and assurance in his dream 
experiences, even as they generally send a shiver down the spines 
of those who don’t believe in such things. Changelings who experi-
ence both a prophetic dream and later see it come true may instead 
regain a point of Glamour, bolstered as they are by the sudden 
contact with the power of the Wyrd.
    Nightmares: What wish fulfillment dreams are to hopes 
and  desires,  nightmares  are  to  insecurities  and  fears.  Most 
dreamers experience the occasional nightmare — a dream that 
contains imagery, experiences or memories that provoke a fear 
response. Such dreams are quite terrifying and, in the case of re-
curring nightmares, can actually contribute to poor health and 
psychological stress. Nightmares are intensely personal. What 
creates great fear in one person may simply be an odd dream 
for another. Therefore, the kinds of nightmares a character 
experiences tells much about what he fears, hates or generally 
has negative associations with. Similar to many dreams, however, 
nightmares can be tremendously symbolic: what appears to be simply a 
strange dream about clowns and playgrounds may actually be symbolic 
associations with being abused as a child to the dreamer.

human context that drives those behaviors. (And, yes, 
some mortals seem to lack that context even before 
they enter the Hedge. Does that mean they are born 
without souls? It’s a question the brave might explore.)
    Mechanics: In game terms, the Thorns of the 
Hedge strip Morality away. A character with a low 
Morality score degenerates much more quickly than 
someone with a high Morality score, and is less likely 
to notice that anything is changing. 
    When a mortal (including mages, ghouls, wolf-
blooded and Sleepwalkers but not vampires and were-
wolves) leaves the path in the Hedge, she loses one 
dot of Morality per hour spent wandering through 
the Thorns. After each hour, the player can roll the 
new Morality rating to realize what is happening. The 
character  feels  emotionally  and  mentally  drained. 
She cannot focus her thoughts beyond “keep moving 
forward” and has difficulty attaching words to con-
cepts. She can talk about objects and situations that 
are physically present, but slowly loses the ability to 
displace language, that is, to conceive and talk about 
ideas, people and objects that aren’t currently part of 
her experience. 
    If the character realizes that the Thorns are to 
blame for this problem, she might try to find the path 
again. This is handled by a roll of Intelligence + In-
vestigation, but remember that trying to navigate the 
Hedge while not on a path always carries a –3 dice 
modifier. It is much more likely that a person who 
loses part of herself to the Hedge will continue wan-
dering until it the rest entirely gone. If a person man-
aged to return to the human world, she suffers this 
loss in the form of the lost Morality dots. This doesn’t 
manifest as a sudden drop in ethics but rather in a 
newfound callousness toward other people or, more 
properly, an inability to understand and care about 
other people. Mortals, of course, can regain lost Mo-
rality by behaving in appropriate ways (see p. 94 of the 
World of Darkness Rulebook), and the Storyteller 
might consider allowing mages to regain lost Wisdom 
in the same manner. 
    Changelings, being partly fae, don’t have to worry 
about this effect. The Hedge does strip them of power, 
however. Whenever the Hedge would normally take 
away a dot of Clarity, the Hedge tears a point of Glam-
our from a changeling. Normally, this would simply be 
annoying, but the many dangers of the Hedge make 
losing even a bit of this power potentially deadly.
    Vampires  and  werewolves,  since  they  are  nei-

Thorns. The state of a vampire’s “soul” is murky in-

                                       fell out of a big full-length one in a department 
                                       store, and I ran when the alarm rang. Scratch 
                                       stumbled and fell out of a mirror in a hotel, 
                                       scared  some  poor  dude  half  to  death  as  he 
                                       banged his secretary. Blithe dove out through 
                                       one  of  those  big  mirrors  over  a  vanity  and 
                                       wound up under a sheet; the house was empty 
                                       and all the furniture covered. Topaz, well, his 
                                       mirror broke as he came out of it, and the cuts 
                                       on his leg were so deep that he had to go the 
                                       hospital. And Little Amy pulled herself from 
                                       a rearview mirror. Or at least, that’s what she 
                                       says. I don’t know. She’s not that little.
                                           We  all  met  up  a  week  later.  We  were  all 
                                         scared.  None  of  us  knew  anything,  except 
                                          that we weren’t going back . We didn’t even 
                                          know where   back  was, we just knew it was 
                                        bad and we weren’t going. 
   We all came out of mirrors, so we called ourselves the Bad Luck motley. The other 
folks in the city thought it was pretty weird, us all coming out together, maybe we’d all 
escaped the same Keeper? And when someone said that, Amy’d start to cry and Blithe 
got all jumpy and Scratch grabbed my arm and squeezed, so I asked them to let it drop.
   Bad luck comes in packages of seven years when you break a mirror, but there were 
only five of us. When we all noticed the tattoos on our backs, we figured out that the 
symbols meant numbers and ours were 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7. Two numbers — 1 and 5 — miss-
ing. Two of us hadn’t come out of the mirrors, or maybe we just hadn’t found them. 
   So here we are standing in front of that big mirror in the empty house. Topaz is look-
ing at the floor, Scratch is fondling his rusty knife, Blithe is trying to calm Little Amy 
down, but I’m just looking through the mirror into the Thorns. I’m thinking that some-
one’s in there, someone who is still back. And I can’t walk away from that. 
   No matter where  back  is, I can’t leave somebody there. I know that much.

the Fair Folk (perhaps from among their more recalcitrant 
slaves) to discourage changeling servants from attempting 
to return to the mortal realm. No matter where they came 
from, briarwolves are some of the singularly most fright-
ening creatures that make their home in the Hedge. 
    Description: The most fearsome aspect of briarwolves 
is not their razor-sharp claws or their gaping muzzles full 
of jagged teeth. It’s not even the smell of old blood that 
surrounds them as a product of their preferred hunting 
style or the eerie echoes of their howls to one another 
through the Thorns. The single most terrifying thing 
about briarwolves is that they’re human — or at least 
they were at one point. 
    Although they run just as easily on four legs as two, 
they are completely capable of standing bipedal, especially if 
it aids with their hunting. And while they may possess almost 
any combination of human and animal predator physical 
characteristics, their eyes always retain a human aspect. 
    Storytelling Hints: When a briarwolf pack has lo-
cated its quarry, the members begin to stalk it from a dis-
tance, baying out to one another across the thickets of 
the Hedge. Although they are certainly capable of 
stealth, they prefer to announce their presence, 
raising as much fear in their prey as possible 
before beginning their actual attack. Their 
howls tend to create a flight reaction in those 
who hear them, inciting panic and some-
times even flushing an otherwise safe victim 
from its sanctuary. 
    Once  the  pack’s  prey  has  begun  to  flee, 
the chase is on. Briarwolves eat meat, but also feed 
upon emotions, with a strong preference for fear, 
pain  and  desperation.  To  this  end,  briarwolves 
will chase their intended victim to the point of 
exhaustion, nipping first at non-vital bits to injure,

Noppera-Bo 
    Quote: “You are lucky I was here to help. I know a shortcut.”
    Background:  One  of  the  greatest  challenges  facing 
changelings is their lack of firm identity. The Noppera-Bo 
are hobgoblins that seem to embody that lack of identity 
and use it against those who travel within the Brambles. 
The Noppera-Bo were perhaps born of trickery, confusion 
and fear, or perhaps of changeling’s own self-doubts, made 
solid by the inherent power of the Hedge. Regardless of their 
nature, they are a real danger to those who travel the Hedge. 
Although usually more impish than overtly malevolent, 
the Noppera-Bo take great pleasure in tricking travelers 
and leading them astray, often into the same perilous 
situations the hobgoblins profess to be attempting to avoid. 
Sometimes, however, for reasons known only to them, a 
Noppera-Bo will directly serve the will of one of the True 
Fae, leading those who would follow it directly into servi-
tude, or worse.
    Description: The  Noppera-Bo  most  often  appear 
initially masked as normal humans or changelings. They 
can take the form of any kith or seeming, but most often 
choose appearances that are either akin to those the 
hobgoblins wish to trick or that will be likely to elicit 
sympathy from their victims. Their masked forms 
are normally small in stature, however, and they 
often appear injured, ill or simply emaciated. Nop-
pera-Bo are especially fond of taking the shape of 
small children or beautiful, frail females. 
    Those who have encountered the Noppera-Bo 
report that the clothing they initially appeared in 
was similar in style to their own, and that the creatures 
spoke to them in a tongue understandable to each of the

folklore speak about those who barely escaped the Wild Hunt 
with their lives, or of those who were taken and never seen 
again. In recent history, the Horned Hunter has rarely been 
seen in the mortal world, seeming to prefer the supernat-
ural wilderlands of the Hedge for his hunting grounds. 
Rumors exist, however, of freeholds he has visited. Al-
though the stories vary, certain elements remain consistent. 
While damage to the building and grounds was minimal, 
not a single changeling escaped alive. The bodies of 
some were found arrow-shot, gutted or hound-mauled. 
The rest were dragged off in chains, presumably to re-
place slain members of his hunting pack.
    Description: Just as many of the True 
Fae,  the  Hunter  can  affect  a  variety  of 
forms, although he certainly has favorites. 
He sometimes appears as a giant of a man 
wearing the head and neck of a mas-
sive elk, stag, bull or goat, sometimes 
with the lower legs or feet of the same. 
Other times, his face and neck 
are   human   as   well,   boast-
ing  broad  sweeping  antlers 
or massive sharp horns. His 
skin may be pale, but is more often dark as 
night, lit only by the pale gleam of his eyes 
and a trail of witch-fire.
    Regardless of the form he takes, he is a 
powerful and electrifying sight to behold. More

out in the open, disguised as ordinary open-air markets or hidden amongst mortal attrac-
tions such as Seattle’s Pike’s Peak Market or San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, but even 
if such places do exist, they are the exception to the rule. Most Markets are hidden 
away in obscure locations or within the Hedge precisely to keep the number of 
unwanted visitors to a minimum. Changelings are generally welcomed, at least 
grudgingly, but too-accessible Goblin Markets have a distressing tendency to at-

World of Darkness.
    The location of the most prominent Goblin Market in a freehold’s 
vicinity (which may be the only one, depending on the freehold’s size and 
population) is usually common knowledge among most experienced change-
lings in the vicinity, but even then there are certain signs an alert changeling can 
watch for to discern the location and timing of a Goblin Market. In urban areas, birds 
might perch in peculiar patterns on wires near the entrance to the 
Market, or debris might be found stacked in shapes reminiscent 
of  standing  stones  or  faerie  rings.  In

                                       thought this would be over quickly, that the man 
                                       standing in front of him would die at the end of his 
                                       blade and he would walk back through the gateway 
                                       to his victim’s woman. He had already taken her, 
                                       changing his face so that it looked like his enemy’s. 
                                       Hence the duel. 
                                           He smiled, and tightened his grip on the hilt of 
                                       his knife. “Make your declaration,” he said.
                                           “I, Aston of the Autumn Court, challenge you to 
                                       a duel. We shall fight, and we shall not stop until one 
                                       of us lies dead. That is my declaration.” 
                                           “I accept your challenge.” He had no need to 
                                       name himself, for he did not use a name. He did not 
                                       claim allegiance to a Court. He refused to tie himself 
                                       to anything. No woman and no words held him.
                                           The duel began. He drew out his knife and  
                                       advanced on his opponent. Aston stood there, still 
                                       and silent.
                                           No, not silent. Whispering. What was he saying?
                                           “Come back, boy. I haven’t done with you yet. 
                                       You’ll kneel before me and do my bidding, boy. 
                                       You’ll take what I give you and thank me, else you’ll 
                                       find yourself bent over and serving my stable hands 
                                       again! Come back here, boy, or I’ll change myself 
before our fun tonight, and you can barely breathe as it is!”
   The words of his Keeper. He felt tears well up, and his knife dropped to the ground. He 
looked to both sides, but saw only the unforgiving Thorns of the Hedge. 
   Aston stepped forward and pointed at him. “On your knees, boy.” He could only obey. 
Aston reached down and picked up the knife. “Shut your eyes.”
   “Please,” he whispered. 
   “I am Aston of the Autumn Court,” said his opponent, “Marquis of Shameful Remem-
brance.” The knife slid home, and he heard the last sounds he ever would. “Shame you put so 
little stock in names, or you might have known what that meant.”

Otherwise, those who wish to join are usually allowed to join. The other Bishops discuss 
it, but even if a changeling enters who doesn’t deserve the grace and wisdom of the order, 
 the other Bishops will make him deserve it. They recognize that they’re only as strong 
  as their weakest link, and if that means dragging one of their own headlong into 
   helping others and farming out goodwill through pledges, then that’s what they’ll 
           do. The Bishops have little problem in “motivating” their slacking brethren. 
            Motivation may come at the end of an hours-long lecture — or from a swift 
            reprimand at the end of a cudgel. 
                Certainly there are those the Bishops want nothing to do with, and 
               most new Bishops require a vote of confidence from a majority of the 
                existing members. Ultimately, though, the Blackbird Bishops want more 
                changelings in their order, and believe it’d be ideal if everybody felt the 
               same way they did about helping one another (even if it means playing 
               the martyr to do so). 
                    Mien:  The Bishopric doesn’t assert any common appearance or 
              dress code among its Bishops, except for a single bird pendant hammered 
        out of tin and painted black. The order expects its Bishops to wear this pendant 
       somewhere within sight — usually pinned to a lapel or hung around the neck via 
      a small chain. A Bishop’s mien is a whole different matter. Changes to a Bishop’s 
      mien are at first subtle, with feathers (usually the black and brown feathers of the 
     common blackbird, though some manifest red-tipped feathers or oily blue-black 
     feathers) appearing from beneath sleeves, cuffs and collars. These feathers some-
      times drift away and fall to the ground around the changeling’s feet. 
          The other changes are more extreme. A Bishop’s eyes may take on the round 
      black glassiness of a bird’s. His feet, too, may turn knobby and shriveled, ending in 
       hooked talons. As Wyrd increases, the number of feathers grows before they drop 
        to the ground, left behind for some humans to find. (Humans, too, feel odd in 
          the presence of high-Wyrd Bishops — mortals grow abnormally superstitious, 
           refusing to step on sidewalk cracks or walk beneath ladders.)
                 Background: The Bishopric is home to three types of changelings, for 
              the most part: those who take comfort in feeling righteous and needed, 
               those who genuinely want to do some good in this world and those who 
                have crawled their way up from the bleak pits of slavery and madness and 
                  are trying to find some way to mitigate the horrors they’ve experienced. 
                    The latter group features changelings who are just happy they have 
                     a place in this world and aren’t tangled in the Hedge, bloodied and 
                      forever lost. The righteous changelings will do anything to prove 
                        themselves correct and virtuous, and by doing so, they coinci-
                         dentally contribute some good to this world. Those Lost who 
                           genuinely seek good things are fewer and further between 
                              than the order prefers to admit — worse, when a change-
                                 ling is genuinely committed to the sanity and security 
                                 of others, he often does so at the cost of his own. The 
                                   good ones always seem to become martyrs.
                                         Socially,  some  may  have  belonged  to  the 
                                        Courts, but many of the Bishops long drifted 
                                         between  the  Courts,  earning  goodwill  but 
                                         rarely  committing  themselves  to  any  one

                                         a place before, and now they do. (This is why 
                                           many Blackbird Bishops are zealously com-

ing. Two years, 10 years, a lifetime — the pledge remains (or the tutor becomes suscep-
tible to the apprentice’s changeling powers from the breaking of a promise). In 
most cases, if the apprentice is woefully unprepared, then it’s up to the student 
to quit. The tutor won’t break his pledge (though she may attempt to force her 
student to quit, thus ending the pledge). 
    When the tutor deems that a student’s apprenticeship comes to an 
end, that’s it. At that moment she is brought before the rest of the College, and 
they finalize her oath to the order. 
    Mien: Certainly, most diviners tend toward scholarly appearances, 
maybe choosing a houndstooth suit jacket and tie, or a 
simple buttoned-down shirt with khaki pants. Others 
take their supposedly sacred roles as diviners more 
seriously (especially if they’re “official” diviners 
for one or several Courts), wearing elabo-
rate robes or other ceremonial garb to 
indicate their station. While the Col-
lege  in  general  has  never  formalized 
any raiment for its augurs, the order in 
a given freehold may have. The College 
in Miami may don plain white robes, as 
white as the Florida sun. The College of 
London may instead wear black robes with 
red  braiding  and  elaborate  stitching  and 
needlework meant to indicate one’s train-
ing or exploits. 
    A diviner’s mien changes in a num-
ber  of  ways.  The  most  obvious  and  dis-
concerting  change  is  the  suggestion  of 
worms crawling beneath the skin — the 
flesh rises and moves as never-seen worms 
squirm  and  burrow.  (Some  say  that  as 
Wyrd increases to abnormally high levels, 
the worms do sometimes pop out of the 
skin — and then crawl away to the near-
est crevice or cubbyhole.) The other change 
is the pair of eyeglasses that appear perched upon a diviner’s 
nose. The eyeglasses may be in any shape, composed of any 
metal — round and silver, gold and square — but the com-
mon theme is that the lenses themselves are always cracked 
(though  the  diviner’s  sight  remains  excellent).  As  Wyrd 
grows, the cracks deepen and multiply.
    Background: The intellectual and academic change-
lings find that the College of Worms is perfect for them. It 
allows them to expand and engage their minds, furthering 
their studies. Many diviners come from various intellectual 
pursuits — college professors, students, writers, artists or 
world travelers — because this allows them to continue 
doggedly pursuing their own theories and interests. The 
College is a haven for such types.
    Of course, it’s also a haven for conspiracy theorists, 
Glamour junkies and paranoid schizophrenics. The twist-
ing strands of fate are insane enough all on their own, 
and sometimes the off-kilter or mad find that the College 
is just the place to “express” themselves. Some come to the

that the Icebound Dukes and Duchesses don’t maintain a very positive rela-
tionship with the fae of the Spring Court. The Icebound changelings have, 
in a way, pilfered the Spring Court’s attack on “desire” and are doing it in 
their own selfish way. A rivalry exists between the Court and the order. 
    Mien: The Icebound Dukes and Duchesses dress to impress. Each 
member of the order has an angle to play, and exterior appearance 
helps to reinforce that angle. One Duchess plays the “troubled 
waif” role, appearing in the dress of a humble, oft-abused ur-
chin girl. A Duke might alternately play up the role of the 
sensitive loner (clothes off the racks at the Salvation Army, 
white iPod headphones dangling from the ears) or power-
broker playboy (sharp-angled suits, polished shoes, engraved 
money clip). The changeling’s outward exterior always helps to 
reinforce whatever persona that character uses to get her way.
    The fae’s mien changes, too. The normal trappings of the Win-
ter Court are present, only moreso: breath of frost, icy skin, hoary 
eyes. Another change to one’s mien is the addition of frozen 
tears that cling to the character’s face. These tears are more 
symbolic than realistic, looking like frozen teardrops fas-
tened to the cold skin of the character’s cheek. As 
one’s Wyrd increases, so do the number of tears. 
A Duke or Duchess with an abnormally high 
Wyrd score begins to have trouble at her 
task, because those tears seem to give off a 
palpable aura of sorrow. Those around 
them begin to feel overwhelmed 
by it — which, as it turns out, 
makes it difficult for them to ply 
their trade in broken hearts.
    Background:  Those   who 
belong to the Duchy were usually 
once emotionally available — too 
available, really, for in most of them it meant being used, abused and dis-
carded. These fae belong to the Winter Court for a reason. The grief 
they’ve suffered in this life both before and after being snatched away 
to Faerie is usually significant. Some suffered near-constant heartbreak, 
jumping from relationship to relationship, flitting through a cascading 
series of codependent lovers and cruel paramours. Others suffered more 
tangible tragedies: loved ones lost in accidents, injuries suffered by 
abusive parents, extreme anguish at the hands of the True Fae. 
    Membership in the Duchy allows these changelings to turn 
the tables on their own sorrow, refusing ever again to be sidelined 
by sadness. (The reality is not always so easy; some suggest that the 
changelings of the Duchy have only hidden their sadness in that icy 
heart, and by refusing it, it only grows. The frozen tears that come as part 
of the Icebound seeming represent the most obvious clue.)
    Stat-wise, most Icebound Dukes and Duchesses have strong Social At-
tributes and Skills, though many didn’t start out with Social being primary, 
having only developed such Skills through their inclusion in the 
Duchy. Many such changelings specialize in one or two key Social 
Skills, much as a weapons trainer might be uniquely skilled with a 
particular sword or pistol. A consummate “life of the party” Duke might possess

 And so, they tend to freeze out potential Magistrates of whom the current Magis-
trates don’t approve. They make life difficult for such a novitiate (before he makes the 
  pledge to become a Magistrate), or ignore his requests entirely. They never act so 
  obviously as to make threats, but threats often become implicit in their actions. 
        Of course, that’s not to say a character can’t join the Magistrates after 
     they’ve written him off. He simply has to play them at their own game, and 
    find some leverage against them. Either that, or meet with their approval in 
   the first place.
                                                Mien:  Many  Magistrates  dress 
                                             professionally   and   humbly.   Some 
                                             wear simple suits and dresses, oth-
                                           ers plain robes. Not all resist dressing

                                  tors and creators of some of the greatest and 
                                 most necessary events held by the freehold. The 
                                chance to enter the spotlight for a time is compel-
                              ling to some, though other Magistrates often frown 
                           upon those that give into such brazen urges.
                           A Magistrate’s mien changes in one substantial way: 
               the slowly oozing wax mask that the changeling may don over 
                his normal face. The mask is largely faceless and featureless, with 
                dollops of fresh wax occasionally breaking open and running in 
                rivulets down the length of the face. Sometimes, the mask takes 
                 on the color schemes of whatever Court is in charge at the time 
                 — green for Spring, reds and oranges for Summer and so forth. 
                 However, a telling sign is that a Magistrate belonging to one 
                 Court above others often finds that his wax mask reveals his al-
                 legiance: even if the Court of Fear is currently in power, if the 
                 Magistrate belongs to the Winter Court, his mask may show the 
                 icy blues and hoarfrost whites of his own people.
                    Background: Those who join the Magistrates of the Wax 
                Mask are generally of two sorts. They’re changelings who believe 
               themselves bound to duty and so they join the order with the in-
               tent of performing work for the freehold, or they’re the young Turks 
               of the region who see the Magistrates for the opportunity the order 
              presents. Too often, the first group often loses sight of its humble 
              stance and ends up just like the second group — the potential to 
              claim hidden leverage and secret authority is just too good to pass up 
             for many such creatures.
                Inevitably, those entering the order are proficient in either Men-
           tal or Social Skills or Attributes. Those who find Mental stats domi-
          nant tend to remain in the lower ranks of the group, finding themselves 
          tasked time and again with the administrative duties (see “Quaestor,” 
         below). Those who become Magistrates and have Social stats as primary 
       (or develop them over their time within the order) usually rise to greater 
      things. This isn’t universally true, of course. A particularly cunning Magis-
      trate with little social grace may still find himself able to outwit the others 
    (they rely on honeyed tongues, while he relies on a sharp mind), but it’s less 
    common than changelings would like to admit.
          Organization: The Magistrates give themselves over to a rather strict 
          three-tiered  organization.  Those  on  the  lowest  tier  are  known  as 
          Quaestors, and are responsible for what other Magistrates perceive as all 
          the “boring” stuff: lists of names, inventories of items, finances, calen-
      dars. The Quaestors handle all administrative manners.

who belong to this order must dwell within the border marches. To live on 
either side is to declare one’s uncertainty and cowardice, and the Margra-
vate cares little for either.
    Some March Lords are more demand-
ing  than  others.  In  one  freehold,  the 
Margravate might take any Lost who 
have outwardly rejected the Courts 
and their noble vanities. To them, 
nothing   else   matters.   Eschewing 
the  Courts  is  proof  enough,  and 
everybody  has  some  kind  of  skill 
they can bring to the table, whether 
it’s  hammering  nails  or  writing  mis-
sives. In another freehold, however, the March Lords may de-
clare a prohibition against weakness, demanding only the salti-
est, most stalwart fae to stand against the freehold’s adversaries. 
These veteran outposts tend to include only the most hardened 
changelings — those with mean eyes, angry words and scars that 
itch and tingle when the weather turns bad. 
    Mien: For the most part, the March Lords and Ladies look nothing 
like Lords or Ladies. They tend to dress in old secondhand clothing, es-
chewing any interest in luxury or fashion. Many wear hats to help conceal 
their faces (without walking around with masks on, as that would surely 
spook the humans). A few appear utterly disheveled, draping themselves 
in the filthy rags and looking more like the homeless than anything.
    Their miens only reinforce this. Their skin is always covered in the 
red, brown or ashen dust that occasionally blows off them in an un-
felt wind. The grit and grime lurks everywhere upon them: between 
their teeth, ringing their callused hands, clumping on eyelashes and 
brows. Shadows, too, drift across them, as if sun-concealed clouds 
move swiftly overhead. 
    Background: The Margraves come from various backgrounds, as 
much a ragtag bunch of changelings as the rumors suggest. One change-
ling may have suffered merciless cruelties at the hands of the other nobles, 
and now uses the Margravate as an excellent focus for his anger and disdain. 
Another might have come from within one of the Courts: having existed 
as a noble, the politicking and gameplaying became too much to bear, ulti-
mately weakening his Clarity. The Margravate therefore represents a place to 
escape all that, where politics are simple and bitter social games are (usually) 
shunned. Other Margraves are young changelings who want to “change” 
the dynamic, and some are older fae who have been cast into exile for 
real or perceived crimes. The changelings of the Brim represent a 
rather eclectic, ragtag bunch of individuals. 
    Most changelings enter the Margrave with, or soon de-
velop, a strong reliance on Physical and Mental stats. In par-
ticular, they tend to favor Power and Resistance Traits (Intel-
ligence, Strength) above anything else. Merits tend to focus 
similarly (standard Merits for the Margraves include Common 
Sense, Danger Sense, Strong Back and Strong Lungs). Ob-
viously, Court Contracts are in short supply. 
    Organization: If the Margravate’s numbers in a given 
freehold support it, the order considers the Brim to be the 
order’s own lesser freehold, like a smaller kingdom that 
rings the larger. The Margraves tend to have one or sever-

— saving an infant, delving deep into the Hedge, executing his 
fetch in a bloody rooftop duel — thus draws the attention of 
other  Gilded  Aspirants.  This  order  of  legend-hungry  war-
riors  doesn’t  see  this  changeling  as  competition,  but  as kin. 
He belongs with them, for he is beyond capable, clearly worth 
the  words  spoken  about  him.  In  this  case,  the  fae  of  the  Sa-
cred Band are the ones who extend the invite… and they fully 
expect  all  changelings  to want  to  belong  to  their  order.  
When a fae turns down the invitation to join such 
a “gilded legacy,” be a part of the so-called Gold-
en Standard, it’s an insult of the highest order. 
Some Aspirants let such a slight slide, but many 
engage in bitter reprisals, spreading slander (or 
digging up nasty truths and spreading them, in-
stead) and ensuring that the changeling won’t 
be a part of any lasting legends. The Aspirants 
hate it when other changelings outside the or-
der gain glory, and do what they must to stop 
that from happening.
    The second way a changeling joins the 
ranks of the Sacred Band is by pleading to be 
a part of the order — and most Gilded As-
pirants really do demand that a changeling 
begs. If they find that such entreaties are 
humble  enough  and  appropriately  self-
deprecating,  they  ask  the  change-
ling to go out into the world and 
impress them. Some make this as 
ambiguous  as  possible,  setting 
no single challenge beyond that 
vague  charge.  Others  ask  for  a 
specific task to be performed: defeat 
a beast from the Hedge, steal an earring from 
a known loyalist or challenge another fae’s fetch to 
a duel and win. Most are honorable enough about 
this, and completing the task as asked is usually 
enough to warrant entrance into the order. A few 
Aspirants play a changeling’s eagerness or syco-
phancy, continuing to demand new tasks (usually 
ones that serve the Aspirant’s own selfish inter-
ests), making the puppet dance while the strings 
are still connected.
    It’s worth mentioning that, out of the two ways 
to join, changelings of the first type are generally bet-
ter regarded within the order than fae of the second. 
Those who begged to join must work to remove the rep-
utation of being toadies and brown-nosers, even though 
that’s what the order demanded of them to join in the 
first place.
    Mien: Changelings of the Sacred Band like to appear 
impressive. They wear whatever clothes will earn

    Scary stories and urban legends. Are they real? Most 
times, no. Sometimes, though, they’re real — or real enough 
to matter, with seeds of truth buried within the tale. This 
noble order of the Autumn Court takes unto itself great pride 
in making such urban myths a reality. The Ministers give truth 
to those that already exist in the local consciousness, and they 
invent others out of whole cloth. Fear is their tool: blunt as a 
cudgel, sharp as a scalpel. 
    Why do they do it? First, fear is the way of the Autumn 
Court. It is what resonates most intimately with the Court’s 
ideals and practices. The Scarecrow Ministry simply chooses 
to embody that by acting as monsters.
    Ultimately, though, the reason they give most often for 
their actions is that humanity isn’t scared enough. The world is 
a bad place, and one misstep into the wrong doorway or down 
the wrong hiking path might invoke a lifetime (or more) of 
misery. The Ministers believe they are doing humanity 
a profound service in keeping them scared, and thus, 
keeping them safe. Of course, the trick is, it requires 
the changelings of the Scarecrow Ministry to be pro-
active. The Ministers accept that humans are fools, 
just as likely to choose the dangerous road as the 
safe one — unless they’re given sufficient evidence 
to travel the straight and nar-
row. Severed fingers, harrowing 
chases,  bad  dreams  —  what-
ever it takes to keep alive the idea 
that Here There Be Monsters. 
    How do they do it? Every motley 
has its ways, some crueler than others. 
One Minister might use his own capable 
storytelling to spread a few proper lies 
caged  as  true  stories.  (“Didn’t  you 
hear?  The  meat  from  their  ham-
burgers  contains  roach  eggs.  They 
incubate in your salivary glands. A 
friend of my brother’s lost part of his 
face that way. I wouldn’t eat there.”) 
Another might use illusion or dreamshaping to en-
sure the persistence of local myths (in a dream, the 
changeling might vilify one of the local entrances into 
the Hedge, thus helping to ensure the dreamer will 
go nowhere near that place). Others still act out the 
legends they hope to create, doing whatever grim 
and grisly act is necessary to keep a tale living 
long past its first telling (if a dark forest road is 
known for the misfortune it brings upon 
those  who  walk  there,  a  Minister 
might wait there and, upon finding

                        ing it for someone special.
                            I find her dancing in a big group of people. I don’t know her name, 
                        but I think I’ve seen her here before (then again, just at the moment 
                        I’m a little too fucked up to say for certain). I dance my way over and 
                        yell, “Hey, you like apples?” at her. If she knows what that means, 
                        she’ll follow me outside. If not, she’ll just think I’m an idiot, and I can 
                        live with that.
                            She follows me out, and the bouncer nods at me because he knows 
                        I’ll hook him up later if he lets me back in. The girl follows me into an 
                        alleyway and says, “Now, what did you say?”
                            OK, that’s weird. Why’d she follow if she didn’t understand me? 
                        “You like apples?” I ask again. 
                            “Sure,” she says. 
                            Now, the end of that particular pickup line is, “Me, too. Wanna 
                        fuck?” but normally the exchange doesn’t go that far because it’s just 
                        a quick way to see if someone wants a hit. She doesn’t seem like she 
                        knows that, but if she’s a narc she’s got me fooled, so I hand her the pill.
   She looks over her shoulder, and says, in a whisper that barely makes it through my haze, 
“Is that Ecstasy?” Who the fuck calls it that outside of health class?
   “Yeah,” I say. She reaches for it. And then something really strange happens. She goes fly-
ing backwards like somebody yanked on her belt. And I get this dull   thud  in my gut, and my 
pants are all wet. The pain catches up with me a second later, and I’m on the ground gasping.
   This big, muscular bleach-blond dude is standing over me with a pipe in his hands. “Tell 
you what, dipshit,” he says. “You tell your buddies to stay the hell away from Princess Maria, 
and I’ll only hit you one more time.”

Brer Spider
    Quote: “No, I’m sure we’ve never met before.”
    Background: To the Autumn Court, Johnny Shanks 
is  a  Leechfinger  sleep  researcher,  studying  the  medical 
side effects of night terrors on mortals even as he har-
vests Glamour from his subjects’ fears. He’s eccentric, but 
harmless; if anyone asked, they’d quickly learn that no 
one seems to know when he joined the Leaden Mirror, 
but no one ever does. To the Winter Court, Black Jules 
is a shadowy Skitterskulk lurking in the abandoned tene-
ments in the bad part of town. If you’re having troubles 
with an enemy, he can brew you up a poison that no magic 
can detect and even the heartiest constitution can’t re-
sist. All he asks in payment is a stray cobweb from your 
dreams. To the mortal inhabitants of Little Haiti, Old Ti 
is an houngan of considerable power and wisdom. When 
you’re troubled by bad dreams, he can sell you a charm he 
learned from an Ojibwa medicine man that will give you 
the sweetest dreams you can imagine.
    In truth, all three are the same man. The changeling 
who calls himself Brer Spider wears many faces, and it’s 
a rare individual who knows more than one of them. No 
one knows where Spider came from or how long he’s been 
here, but those few who even know he exists know him as 
the pre-eminent oneiromancer in Miami. He has studied 
dreams as few others before him, from the mystical aspects 
to the psychology and the physiological aspects.
    Description: Brer Spider wears so many faces it’s hard 
to even guess which one might be real. He has been tall and 
                                                           dream-relics from the Hedge or from the minds of dream-

tween. He’s been a Beast and an Elemental, a goblin soldier

                 ou remember your home . 

                 You remember what it was like,  
                 before They took you.  
                 The sound of your family’s voices,  
                 the smell of your home,  
                 the colors of your neighborhood.  
      Even after the blinding glories  
      and pitiless dark wastes of Faerie,  
      you remember . 

      Your memories were a beacon.  
      Without them, you would never have found your way back  
      through the twisting maze of the Thorns,  
      to collapse torn and exhausted on the cool earth  
      of the world you were born in once more —  
      to find that your home wa s no lon ger yours,  
      that an impostor had taken over your life,  
      that you had been changed.  
      Yours is beauty and grotesquerie,  
      illusion and iron,  
      insight and madness.

      Where will you go now that you are Lost?  
      Who will you love, who will you war against,  
      who will you make of yourself?  
      How will your tale end?
