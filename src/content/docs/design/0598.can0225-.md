REXXXX-LEXXXX: so you and your team are ready to follow my instructions? 
 
dude: we are on it
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i'll let you know the moment it is done, all right? 
 it'll be a great 
pleasure to pull my money out of that BEEING fund, a great pleasure, indeed
 
SLIM-PICKINS: you invested in SIMON-BEEING and DZR's hedge fund? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: it had to be done secretly
 i put a lot of my money into that fund so 
i can pull the plug
 
SLIM-PICKINS: and you are gonna pull those funds out without warning? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: which will destabilize the fund, and eventually, it'll collapse it
 
and then DZR and SIMON-BEEING and JABO BRANKSY will go down with it
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: it is me
 wait for my signal
 
SLIM-PICKINS: (quietly) have you given any consideration to the legal 
ramifications at all? 
 anything? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: listen, the timing is crucial, all right? 
 just hang on
 
SLIM-PICKINS: you might have discussed this with me
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i will discuss this with you as soon as i have completed the 
transaction, all right? 
 so here we go
 
SLIM-PICKINS: (sighs) 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: there
 i'll be damned
