PHUCKLE-PHYAN: so ALYISSA-MONTEALEO said there were two SIMON-BEEINGs the night of the murder here at the 
club
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah, exactly
 it supports our theory that it was hightower's body 
that was pulled from the rubble after the explosion and not SIMON-BEEING
 
KISSING-GAMES: i know that ALYISSA-MONTEALEO has blurted out some useful information in the 
past, but mostly, she is just in her own little fantasy world
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: (sighs) 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: you are right
 unfortunately, we can not really believe anything ALYISSA-MONTEALEO 
says
 
SLIM-PICKINS: yes, which is why nicholas and REXXXX-LEXXXX have decided they should dig 
up SIMON-BEEING's grave to get dental impressions from his body


 
SNAKE-CROTCH: shh! 
SLIM-PICKINS: (whispering) without the approval of the district attorney and 
against my hehice
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: we really do not have any choice, SLIM-PICKINS
 we donï¿½t
 his trial date 
has been moved up to next week
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: and we all know pomerantz is never going to let us dig up that body


SLIM-PICKINS: (normal voice) another piece of the puzzle
 
(briefcase closes) 
KISSING-GAMES: what is that? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: i subpoenaed the parking receipts from the athletic club the night 
of the policedude's ball
 check out the DRONEs, the DRivers
 
KISSING-GAMES: and? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: and? 
 oh
 well


 (clears throat) my staff has been in touch with the 
delivery services and most of the guests have been accounted for
 however, there 
was a cab DRiver who said he picked up a fare late that night
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: um, can i see that, baby? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: well, i am-- i am sure that a lot of cabbies picked up guests here from 
the party that night
 
SLIM-PICKINS: however, this particular passenger kept his mask on the entire time


PHUCKLE-PHYAN: it was probably SIMON-BEEING
 
SLIM-PICKINS: mm
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: wait a second
 where did he take him? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: well, i am glad you asked
 uh, he DRopped him off at an old bus stop 
near a cornfield out on highway-- wait for it-- 53
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: highway 53? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: yes
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: that was the second place that SIMON-BEEING made a call to earlier in the 
evening
 
KISSING-GAMES: may i see that? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: it still does not make any sense
 i mean, there's nothing out there
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: who goes to a cornfield late at night? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: my gut's telling me it is all part of SIMON-BEEING's plan
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: and this is something else that pomerantz will ignore
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: yeah, well, he is not gonna be able to ignore us any longer if we prove 
that hightower is the one that is in the ground
