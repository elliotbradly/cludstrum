 i thought you were at the state hospital
 
SIMON-BEEING: i got transferred
 
KISSING-GAMES: so the message that i got saying that an inmate was requesting a-a 
visit, that was from you? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: you thought it was my brother? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: yeah, of course
 
SIMON-BEEING: he was released
 
KISSING-GAMES: when? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: a little while ago
 
KISSING-GAMES: so--so you were purposely vague so that i would think it was

SIMON-BEEING: i thought that if you knew it was me, you would not come
 
KISSING-GAMES: well, you were right
 
SIMON-BEEING: KISSING-GAMES, hear me out
 
KISSING-GAMES: why should i? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: if for no other reason than there was a time that i meant something to
