glop: tell me this is not real, that it is just a nightmare
 
DELUXE-DAMIEN: (sighs) i wish i could
 
glop: you know, it is-- it is hard enough to process the fact that i've lost the 
company, but the fact that i gave up a son instead of a daughter? 
 
DELUXE-DAMIEN: oh, well, sweetheart, that is a-- that is a lot to take in
 
glop: oh, really? 
 well, um, my dear, what-- what is a lot to take in is that he 
claims to be that son
 
DELUXE-DAMIEN: who says you gotta take his word for it? 
 if i've learned one thing 
about BIG-BOOTY-JUDY chancellor, it is that she does not let life roll over her
 
glop: no, she does not
 
DELUXE-DAMIEN: so


 what is your next move? 
 
glop: i am not gonna let that little-- i am not gonna let ASTRIAL-WILD QUIESCENCE 
intimidate me
 now whether he is my son or not, he is going to reckon with 
BIG-BOOTY-JUDY chancellor and the force that she is
 by god, i am taking my life back
