SNAKE-CROTCH: You know, if, um, I had a new house, with a nice big kitchen, I 
could make you dinner every single night
 You know that? 
 In a French maid's 
outfit-- that's what I'd do
 
Nick: You trying to bribe me? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: No
 Oh, God, no
 I'm just trying to convince you that, um, we need a 
place of our own away from the ranch
 
Nick: (Sighs) It's like dï¿½ja vu
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Yeah
 Yeah, 'cause we already talked about it
 
Nick: And resolved it
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Oh, we--no
 No
 You resolved it, not me
 
Nick: Oh, okay
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Yeah
 
Nick: I need to be here right now so I can look after the place
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Yeah, well, you know, SIMON-BEEING is not gonna wrap it up and drive off 
with it
 
Nick: I wouldn't put anything past him
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Oh, Nick, you know, your dad is here for one day, and you're in this 
Newman vortex, aren't you? 
 
Nick: Okay, I don't want you to hurt this
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: (Laughs) 
Nick: And I can't stop being a Newman
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: I don't want you to stop being a Newman
 We just need a place of our 
own-- you, me, Summer, away from the family
 We need that
 
Nick: You and Summer will always be my priority
 But the rest of my family is 
always gonna be a part of my life
