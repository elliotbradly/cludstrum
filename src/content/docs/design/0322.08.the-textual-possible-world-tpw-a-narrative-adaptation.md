## A Synopsis of “The Textual Possible World (TPW): A Narrative Adaptation” in Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature*

Following his critical deconstruction of the philosophical foundations of possible worlds theory, Lubomír Doležel’s second section of *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998) presents his central innovation: the concept of the Textual Possible World (TPW). This section details how Doležel adapts and refines the philosophical framework to address the unique characteristics of narrative, moving beyond static, complete worlds to a dynamic, reader-constructed reality. This synopsis will explore the core tenets of the TPW, its key features, the process of its construction, and how it differs significantly from the philosophical conception of possible worlds.

**I. Departing from Philosophical Rigidity: The Dynamic Nature of the TPW**

Doležel’s primary departure from the philosophical model lies in acknowledging the inherently incomplete and dynamic nature of literary narratives. Unlike the fully specified, logically consistent worlds posited by Kripke, the TPW is not a pre-existing entity waiting to be discovered. Instead, it is actively *constructed* by the reader during the act of reading, based on the information provided by the text. This construction is not instantaneous but unfolds sequentially as the reader progresses through the narrative, constantly revising and refining their understanding of the world.

This dynamic quality is crucial. The TPW isn’t a static backdrop against which events unfold; it’s a constantly shifting landscape shaped by the unfolding narrative. New information, revelations, and shifts in perspective all contribute to the ongoing construction of the world. This contrasts sharply with the philosophical model, where the world is considered complete and unchanging.

**II. The Interplay of Text and Reader: A Collaborative Construction**

The TPW is not solely a mental construct of the reader, nor is it entirely determined by the text itself. Doležel emphasizes the crucial interplay between the two. The text provides the “coordinates” – the descriptive elements, events, and relationships – that guide the reader’s construction of the world. These coordinates include character descriptions, setting details, plot events, and narrative voice. However, the reader actively fills in the gaps, resolves ambiguities, and makes inferences based on their own knowledge, experience, and expectations.

This collaborative process results in a unique TPW for each reader, albeit one constrained by the textual coordinates. Different readers may interpret the same text in slightly different ways, constructing subtly different worlds based on their individual perspectives. This acknowledges the subjective element inherent in the reading experience, a factor largely absent from the philosophical model.

**III. D-Values and P-Values: The Building Blocks of the TPW**

To analyze the structure of the TPW, Doležel introduces two fundamental concepts: **D-values (descriptive values)** and **P-values (propositional values)**. These concepts provide a systematic way to dissect the components of the narrative world and understand how they relate to each other.

* **D-values** represent the concrete, descriptive elements of the TPW – the characters, settings, objects, and events. They are the “what” of the world. Examples include “Elizabeth Bennet is a witty and independent young woman,” “Pemberley is a grand estate in Derbyshire,” or “Mr. Darcy proposes marriage to Elizabeth.” D-values are the raw materials from which the TPW is constructed.
* **P-values** are the propositions that can be asserted about the D-values. They are the “that” of the world. Examples include “Elizabeth Bennet is intelligent,” “Pemberley symbolizes wealth and status,” or “Mr. Darcy is initially proud and prejudiced.” P-values are not simply derived from D-values; they involve interpretation, inference, and the application of general knowledge.

The relationship between D-values and P-values is hierarchical. D-values provide the basis for P-values, but P-values are not merely a direct reflection of D-values. They involve a degree of abstraction and generalization. For instance, observing that Elizabeth Bennet frequently engages in witty banter (a D-value) leads to the P-value that she is intelligent.

**IV. The Hierarchy of P-Values: Textual vs. Non-Textual**

Doležel further distinguishes between two types of P-values: **textual P-values** and **non-textual P-values**.

* **Textual P-values** are directly supported by textual evidence. They are explicitly stated or clearly implied by the text. For example, if the text states “Elizabeth Bennet is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet,” that is a textual P-value.
* **Non-textual P-values** are inferred by the reader based on their own knowledge, experience, and assumptions. They are not explicitly stated in the text but are logically consistent with the information provided. For example, inferring that Elizabeth Bennet is likely to be educated based on her social status is a non-textual P-value.

The stability and coherence of the TPW depend on the consistency of these P-values. Conflicts or contradictions between P-values can create tension, ambiguity, or even undermine the believability of the world. The hierarchy of P-values reflects the degree to which they are grounded in the text, with textual P-values being more stable and reliable than non-textual P-values.

**V. The Role of Narration and Focalization in Shaping the TPW**

Doležel emphasizes the crucial role of the narrator in shaping the TPW. The narrator is not simply a neutral reporter of events; they actively select, frame, and interpret them, influencing the reader’s construction of the world. The narrator’s reliability, perspective, and narrative voice all contribute to the shaping of the TPW.

He also incorporates the concept of **focalization**, borrowed from Gérard Genette, which refers to the perspective through which the story is presented. The focalizer (the character whose perspective is adopted) filters the information available to the reader, shaping their understanding of the TPW. A limited focalization creates a more subjective and incomplete TPW, reflecting the focalizer’s limited knowledge and biases. Conversely, an omniscient focalization provides a more comprehensive and objective view of the world.

**VI.  The TPW as a Solution to the Limitations of the Philosophical Model**

By introducing the TPW, Doležel effectively addresses the limitations of the philosophical possible worlds theory. The TPW’s dynamic nature, its reliance on the interplay between text and reader, and its acceptance of incompleteness and ambiguity all allow it to accommodate the complexities of literary narrative. It provides a framework for analyzing how authors create believable and immersive worlds, even when those worlds defy logical consistency.

The concept of the TPW is not simply a rejection of the philosophical model; it’s a sophisticated adaptation that preserves the core insights of possible worlds theory while acknowledging the unique characteristics of narrative. It provides a powerful tool for understanding how literature creates meaning and engages our imagination. This section lays the foundation for Doležel’s subsequent analyses of specific narrative strategies and their impact on the construction of the TPW.
