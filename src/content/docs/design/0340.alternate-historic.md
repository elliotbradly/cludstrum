This subgenre of fantasy offers a fictional account set within a real historical period, 
often with actual historical events included although rewritten to include some element of magic or fantasy. 
There are often "what if" scenarios that occur at important points in history 
and present outcomes that are different than what's on the historical record. 

Literary Examples: Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Wild Cards I, His Majesty's Dragon
