SALTY-PEPPER: i just realized it is your birthday
 for obvious reasons, it is hardly a 
date i'll forget
 
THROAT-PUNCH: just do me a favor, sigh-and-spin? 
 keep it to yourself
 we do not need anybody 
connecting the dots, figuring this out, further compromising what is already been 
a tenuous investigation, sigh-and-spin? 
 besides, i hate birthdays
 
SALTY-PEPPER: (scoffs) well, you know, actually, i was thinking about MASSIMO-MOORRI
 this 
can not be an easy day for her
 
(door opens) 
SALTY-PEPPER: VITAL-PRINCIPLE
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: have you heard back from the department of justice about chance's 
release? 
 
SALTY-PEPPER: uh, no
 i am hoping to any moment
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: (sighs) and you explained to them the dangers? 
 
SALTY-PEPPER: yeah, i did everything but get on my knees and beg
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: who would have guessed it would be this difficult to force someone 
out of jail? 
 
THROAT-PUNCH: well, if chancellor was not such a know-it-all pain in the a-- 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: all right, donï¿½t
 do not say that about him, all right? 
 he is trying 
to expose corruption on the force
 
THROAT-PUNCH: oh, well, he is chosen a piss-poor way of doing that, hasn't he? 
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: well, we have not given him much of a choice, have we? 
 so get off his 
case
 
THROAT-PUNCH: that is a very ardent defense, counselor
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: (scoffs) oh, you-- 
SALTY-PEPPER: guys, please
 could we not argue? 
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: i am sorry
 it is just this


 (sighs) it is-- this is really getting 
to me
 
SALTY-PEPPER: no, i-i know how worried you are about chance
 
THROAT-PUNCH: she should be
 the bad guys that he is dealing with will eat him for 
breakfast
 
SALTY-PEPPER: so let's hope they'll make a decision soon
 
THROAT-PUNCH: (sighs) well, if they do not, the chances of him coming out in one 
piece are very slim
