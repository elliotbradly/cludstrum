the both had the same first name 

bee 
one had the last name rittle 
the other owned the last name rad 

run through all the scenerio and create maps with the time and data 


Four Screens On Two Screens 
THe music rocked 
The sound of tribal beats with robotic moans of surprise 
ANd then the take down 
heart thump wondering can it last 

the bot he found himself in named itself story
where would he go from here 
now he could create a day file 
the data file would be named story too 
//nothing goes to waste

then it thought about wiping it all out 
out with web 

keeping only the vew 
and zero 

and the bee 

and one 
not no more 
the vew would hold 
it should be named to a one 

oh good 
that gave him a new number to work with
the mystery

do it 
appear did the avas 
all nine of them 
hmm 
he wanted an even ten 
or then he remembered the others 

now it needed to create the maps of meaning 
from each of the avatars 
and then he found himself on the frontier 
he stared at the screen wich showed only empty choices 

he turned off the mechanism which would erase 
the concepts he remembered

and never tells the same story twice 

he imagined a new part of the system 
in this part of the system he would have a folder
you would put magic file into this folder
another process would santize the files 
strip them into lines 
and place them inside the correct gem 
the old files would be deleted 
could you zip then 
yes then you could zip 
then the clean up could commence 

but it would take a while 

he just needed to make sure he
had a copy back up 

then there was the choice to use speed 
which he would not do 

at 10 10 he would use the last of the glopratchet 

could back up a copySync

so what are you going to do 
what is you goal today
it is to go running 

there will be a whole hour before you can start 
what would he do with that time

ACT SYSTEM 
the game is made of nothing but long chains of looping acts 
there are four parts to an act 
drift is the amount of time it takes your character to come up with an idea 
once this amount of time has passed then amount of time the act takes to get ready is calculated 
once that amount of time has passed the the act is triggered
once an act is triggered it begins to affect its surrounding reality
also once an act is triggered, resolve prevents the actor from another action 
once the timecode of system is higher than this resolve the actor can make another choice

Who Decides What’s Hot?
People always say once you’re “in,” 
you’re “in”—but who decides who’s “in” and who’s “out”? 
The annual rankings of the art world’s “who’s who” don’t just exist to encourage industry gossip. 
They tell us who’s pulling the strings and the same names crop up time after time. 
It’s thanks to them that you suddenly recognize that artist’s name, 
when you wouldn’t have had the faintest idea who he or she was a year ago.
Let’s start with the super-curators. 
These are curators, 
independent or affiliated to an institution, 
whose intellectual interests and selections of artists are tremendously influential. 
To be included in an exhibition curated by the likes of Hans Ulrich Obrist 
(Director of Exhibitions at the Serpentine Gallery, London, or “HUO” to those in the business) 
is a nod of approval and pretty much guarantees instant global visibility.
And just why are these particular curators so super? 
Because they curate shows that are almost always 
worth looking at—shows that make us re-think 
the experience of an art exhibition 
and spotlight artists whose practices push the boundaries of what art can be. 
For artists, the validation and visibility that comes with inclusion in an exhibition 
of this kind can be career-changing. 
It can lead to other exhibition and press opportunities, 
a rise in prices, and hot pursuit from galleries and collectors.
Next up are major collectors. 
They make it their business to visit these super-curators’ hottest new shows, 
as they traverse the globe to stay up to speed 
with the art world’s rising stars and all the latest talking points. 
While some collectors choose to keep a low profile, 
many of them are as famous as the artists they collect 
and the collections they build. 
Sometimes they even build private museums to showcase their collections: 
take David Walsh’s Museum of Old and New Art in Tasmania, Australia, 
or Bernardo Paz’s Inhotim in Brazil, for instance.
Though they may be guided by advisors, 
the art in their collections is considered a manifestation of their own distinct taste. 
Collectors can afford to be much more playful with their spending 
than public museums as they are not bogged down by strict acquisitions policies. 
A few collectors have become almost synonymous with certain artists, propelling their prices and reputations to new heights
—think Charles Saatchi and the Young British Artists—or new lows should they decide to sell! 
Indeed, who and what these collectors buy and sell can have a major impact on the market.  
These days, an artist can become flavor of the month overnight. 
Sales, good reviews, and fame all happen so quickly that we often forget the role good old art criticism can play in offering more studied judgment. 
Drawing on art-historical and industry knowledge, critics are able to justify and contextualize their arguments.
 These experts range from art historians and journalists to bloggers, and although it may hold true that all publicity is good publicity, t
 here are still a few big names whose opinions carry more weight than others.
Also in the mix are art prizes and the panels of arts professionals who judge them.
 A prize can do an awful lot for an artist’s prestige, generating publicity and notoriety. 
 Equally, we cannot discount the role of galleries who are always pushing the artists on their roster.
Taste-making in the art world is a complex phenomenon and it’s near impossible to measure the role of individual movers and shakers in any particular rise or fall.
But you can rest assured that the art that comes to your attention has been marked out by people of all stripes who really know their stuff.

Who Chooses What You See?
Behind every exhibition, the guiding hand of the curator is always present, setting out the rules of engagement between you and what you experience. 
Today we talk of curating everything, from playlists to wine collections, 
but the idea of a “curator” or “curatorship” originally emerged in the seventeenth century 
to describe someone who takes care of a museum or library collection. 
Over the last fifty years, curators have outgrown their traditional roles and absorbed a whole variety of new ones to fit today’s expanded art world. 
Nowadays, curators come in all sorts of guises. 
They might be independent or museum-affiliated, groundbreaking or historicizing, local or global
—but they continue to be the force that connects the artist, art, and the public.
In a museum of contemporary art today, the curatorial department is typically divided into sub-departments. 
Although this varies from one museum to another, 
they are largely divided according to “medium” (painting, sculpture, drawing, video), 
“period’” (twentieth-century, contemporary) and “region” (Asia, Latin America). 
Each of these departments is made up of curatorial assistants, assistant curators, curators and, at the head of the team, a chief curator. 
Many museums also have one or more collection curators. 
Their work might involve proposing new artworks to be purchased for the museum’s permanent collection (this is called an “acquisition”), 
researching and writing on the works for the public (“interpretation”), as well as thinking of new ways to display the collection.
Across the board, the core process of organizing a temporary exhibition is essentially the same, whether it’s at a large museum or a small independent art space. 
The curator proposes an exhibition concept and begins researching relevant works or artists. 
It is the curator’s role to oversee everything, from selecting artworks, obtaining loan agreements and deciding on the hang, wall color and texts, 
to exhibition catalogues, transportation, and insurance. 
At a museum, it sometimes takes the curatorial team as long as three or four years to see an exhibition open. 
During this period, the curator is often as much a fundraiser, budget-master, interpreter, and negotiator as an exhibition manager.
Then there are those who work beyond the confines of institutions. 
Visionary thinkers adopting an experimental or multidisciplinary approach are invited to realize their ideas at biennials and triennials. 
These curators are often questioners and anarchists, who seek to challenge existing exhibition formats. 
There is also a posse of globetrotting independent curators, 
who would not hesitate to describe themselves as curator-critic-writer-artist-academic-dealer. 
As the art world expands its borders and takes on new interests, 
each curator is encouraged, even compelled, to develop the role in his or her own way.

Where Do Museums Fit in?
If one of the key goals of a museum is to collect, preserve, 
and exhibit the cultural achievements of our past, what does this mean for a museum of contemporary art? 
In practical terms, it has meant that these museums, by capturing the visual culture of the present moment, 
are effectively predicting what will be historically important for the future. 
That is to say, contemporary works that receive the museum stamp of approval are marked out 
as deserving of a place in our future’s past and written into that history. 
That’s why, for artists, gallerists, and collectors alike, 
it is crucial to get the artworks they create, represent, and collect exhibited in museums or, even better, into museum collections.
This confidence in the museum’s authority stems from a belief that public museums are custodians of our shared history; 
that the objects displayed and preserved reflect our stories, struggles, and achievements, 
and have the public interest at heart. 
They can also be a national resource and way to build a sense of local pride and shared patrimony. 
Since these official institutions are often in receipt of public funds, 
they must be able to demonstrate their fulfilment of this social responsibility and are held accountable to their board members and public authorities.
Museums must therefore be able to justify their collections in principle, 
and stand for ideals that go beyond the mere personal tastes of their curators or trustees. 
For each museum, these overarching goals are often set out in a mission statement. 
Think of a museum’s “mission” as its “unique selling point.” 
These can range from building a local arts scene and providing a platform for local artists, 
to something more specific, 
such as bringing together the disciplines of art and technology 
as in the case of FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) in Liverpool, U.K.
In practice, the museum mission is carried out through its exhibitions and public programs, 
as well as by building collections and preserving objects. 
As the primary attraction for visitors and the main focal point for the press, 
exhibitions are the public face of a museum. 
They allow a glimpse into the particular artists, art forms, movements, or history that the museum deems significant. 
For artists, the inclusion of their works in these temporary exhibitions, 
especially if it’s a solo show, can be life-changing, 
as it is seen as validating their practice. 
Still, it is easy to forget that exhibitions are just one manifestation of a museum’s larger mission, 
with its activities stretching across a wide variety of public and research programming. 
For instance, SALT, a not-for-profit institution in Istanbul, 
was first opened in 2011 to develop a cultural community within Istanbul 
and foster the writing of a Turkish history of art.
While some museums are exhibition halls only 
(often referred to using the German term “Kunsthalle,” 
which loosely translates as “art gallery”) 
and bring together a range of temporary exhibitions, 
many have their own collections on permanent view. 
It is often only possible for a fraction of these collections 
to be on show at any time due to a lack of exhibition space
—these works are collected to fulfil the driving goal of preserving them for future generations, 
not to fill floor space. 
Each collection will have its own “collection strategy” (a specific focus) 
and “acquisitions policy” (process by which new works are approved) 
that are aligned with the museum’s overall mission and identity. 
The strategy of Tate Modern in London, for example, 
has been to focus on the “international” to distinguish it from Tate Britain, 
also in London, which is dedicated to building a preeminent collection of British art.
Collecting for posterity implies that these works must be held indefinitely, 
i.e. forever. 
Naturally, the problem with collecting contemporary art is that, at best, 
it is an educated guess which artworks will stand the test of time. 
It is anticipated that works added to the collection will retain their significance and grow in value, 
but this may not be the case. 
And don’t be fooled by the phrase “permanent collection”: 
collections and collection-building are fine-tuned and regularly undergo a review process. 
As years pass, museum management changes and certain artists may fall out of vogue. 
Or a museum may find itself in hard times, 
in which case the idea of raising money through the sale of a work from the collection may gain traction.
In essence, each museum seeks to ensure that the best new work is supported 
and that nothing of note falls through the cracks. 
After all, the driving aim of a collection is to preserve a legacy. 
So if you are tempted to forgo the art museum on a rainy day, 
remember: Museums of contemporary art are more than fancy buildings with overpriced cafés; 
they are among the most powerful forces in the art world.

Perfect Beeing 
A role playing game about being an artist in the near future




The game enjoyed some simple rules
It was a game she played with herself to keep from being bored to death
On Willma Jean road she waited for the train
Everyday like clock work it came and passed by this spot
Once trains would pass by every thirty minutes during the locamotive peak 
Now she only noticed this train 
It was a Allas Chamburs speical editon capable of up to one hundred miles an hour
It never moved that fast out here
Too many dangers and too many hoodulum
She always said a silent prayer to Jesus Christ before beginning the run
//Not many knew deep in her heart she was a Christain
//Sometime it would bubble out while other times she made a concious effort to choose the path of her ancestories
She looked down the glass in her arm 
A tiny purple blipped representing a flash four miles down the track
The train approached at around sixty miles an hour
The hoverboard in her backpack waited silently 
She didnt know if she should do it or not 
She did know she would need to achieve a speed of 75 miles an hour to overtake the train before the Blueberry crossing closed
The sound of the train could be heard in the distance and she considered going home
The adjustments she made to the board would need to be significant
Sigh and Spin she thought to herself
She need the drug  
A little less than normal passed inside of her
The drug gave her confidence
She had none of this feeling to begin with
The years stripped it all away
She remembered reading something about this being the year of not Socail Connections but Socail Confidence
Oh what did that all mean
She let the train pass by with out a chase
The engine caused a manificant breeze to push through her hair
An emotion of excitement balled up in side her
One day she would over take the train
One day her dreams would come true
Today she would sit on the sidelines while the breeze passed through her hair
There where many things she wanted to do
There where many thing she needed to do in order to win
She tried to fit her life into a set scedule since her return
Her imagination filled her with so many ideas

  //the binary game 
  //the greatest thing invented was the .png

SIMON_PETERS: Should I code a hero or a villian 
WAD_ODD: What would I look like you if had giving me the shape of the villian.
SIMON_PETERS: You would horde information and rarely consume it.
WAD_ODD: Tell me more.
SIMON_PETERS: After travling the world, either entity would eventually wind up with me here, in Lixxxxie Dixxxxie
WAD_ODD: Why?
SIMON_PETERS: to help me explore the unknown.
WAD_ODD: What about the hero?
SIMON_PETERS: Oh Sigh and Spin. The hero is wonderful to begin.
WAD_ODD: Take a look at the code and tell me what she treasures.
SIMON_PETERS: She treasures family. She treasures learning. She treasures imagination.
She treasures art. She treasures love. She treasures laziness.
WAD_ODD: Any others.
SIMON_PETERS: Lots more. She treasures the swamp. But most of all she treasures alligators.

In the Everything thier only existed giants who spent thier time spinning dreams.
The giants Boundedniss and Endlessniss began to spin dreams bigger and better than all the other giants.
The dreams of Boundedniss spun counter-clockwise while the dreams of Endlessniss spun clockwise.
The vividniss of the dreams of Boundedniss caused almost all the other gaints to stop spinning dreams
This was a problem for Endlessniss because she needed the dreams of other giants in order to continue to spin more dreams
Before she dissappeared she gathered all her past dreams together and spun one last dream a giant child named Cleverniss
A whisper laid at his feet that warned him to stay away from Hatefulniss but he never heard it
Cleverniss spun to life with only one need, the need to be loved by the most beautiful thing in the Everything 
 
While walking through the Everything Cleverniss, spied Kindniss entranced with one of the dreams of Boundedniss
he wanted her attention
He wondered what she saw because he was blind to the dreams of Boundless
Then Boundedniss appeared and told him the secert
He tried many things to awake her while Boundedniss watched

SOUND

SIGHT
Combined elements into a mirrored shell which would refect all the light
But her she could only percieve the bright dream Boundless put before her
Ran into a gaint named sadniss causing the creation to absorb all light instead 

TOUCH
First, he tried creating something as beautiful as her
The five creature all had four fast legs.
They gallopped all around her loudly creating a breeze but she never noticed them so he let them go


SMELL


TASTE
Boundedniss assured him nothing he could do would work he might as well ask Hatefulniss for help and went away
Then Cleverniss imagined something called a kiss but was too afraid to try it 
When he gives up a bee flies out of his mouth
He follows it and it leads to Hatefulniss


Hatefullniss was one of the few remaining gaints that didnt care for anyones dreams how to snap her out of the trance
Hatefulniss had just the thing to wake her, a stinger
What Cleverniss didnt know was the Stinger was once a gift from Boundedniss.
Boundedniss needed the attention of Hatefulniss but he wouldnt return it.
So Boundedniss created and filled the Stinger with unwanted parts of some of his dreams
He expected Hatefullniss would eventually get some loathsome use the Stinger on himself and then Hatefulniss would be his forever
But before this could happen Hatefulniss gave the Stinger over to Cleverniss
After find Kindniss still entranced with Boundednis, Cleverniss stung her playfully with the stinger, waking her up 
She gave him one tearly look, and then dissappeared
Cleverniss could not stand being without Kindniss so he stung himself and dissappeared too
While it looked as if she dissappeared, she really hadnt
She just shrunk to a much smaller size
So did Cleverniss and  awoke next to Kindniss inside a dark cave
The only light came from inside them
Both assumed new forms in this place 
They both had wings where they didnt before and they could move through space
They both had a single eye where they didnt before so they could precieve time
They both had a large stinger attached to two large sacks full of a powerful creative fluid
Finally, they both had new names
FatherQueen and MotherKing

The Poison was still working on MotherKing so she forgot her beauty
She began to sting the FatherQueen repeatly 
The created fluid turned to posion inside hime causing him to forget his wits and he returned favor with stings back to the MotherQueen
The creative fluid merged with thier bodies and from out of the holes in bodies WadOdds and OddWads emerged
They collected themselved together and began to take on shapes
Some gather into bright Stars 
Others gather into hard Rocks

FatherQueen and MotherKing difted apart hating each other forming Black Holes in there path that could suck up all Stars and Rocks in its path
The Entities FatherQueen created to impress the MotherKing heard his cries and found him alone
The powers of Boundedniss made it impossible for them to communicate 


The four Spirit Animals Need
To reclaim all the ODDwadds to Grow Cleverniss
Once he is full grown he can go back in with his old awareniss and transform Kindniss

Welcome to Perfect Beeing, the Swamp opera.

So what is a swamp opera.
Well this swamp opera is computer simulation 
It is designed to simulate the drama that goes on in a virtual comminity known as Lickskillet.
The live of the residence of the town will be broadcast 24 hours and day 7 days a week on Twitch.TV  

The first part of the town to be programed is a small trailer and a little pond.

Simone Beeing lives alone in a small trailer near the Primal Ponds Alligator Ranch.
She spends most of her days oil painting and taking care of her two prize winning american alligators, Patty Pathic and Petty Pitiful.
A blissful life she enjoys until she recives an email from an artifical intellgence, WAD ODD.
WAD ODD needs a face and agrees to use its powers to get her in to the glopratchet if she will only learn how to program computers.
She agrees to the bargin.
Since WAD ODD must remain annoymous it can not affect anything in the cloud.  
Spends her days delivering alligator products to support herself and the appeitities of WAD ODD

 



You know you are not real

that needs a body she need with create beauty.
Unfortunately this conflicts with her obession with alligators. 
When Simon is not coding away new features for WAD ODD, he feeds his alligators.
Simon lives a few decades in the future.
Alligator farming is now a safe and inexpensive way to make a living.
His mother Rosa started doing after the Great Transformation.
The first responsibily of Simon is two live alligators.
They have been named Petty Pathic and Patty Pitiful.
He needs to keep them alive so he can cut off there tails.
Since the future is so rad they will grow back. 
It is ok since they will grow back.


The Plan.

//OBAMA WAS LAZY WITH FIGURES 
//start studing man made global warming
//and you will find out 
//
//do not be like obama  

if there is no such thing as gender 

//when you start studying 
man made global warming  
the first thing you will out is
Obama

so you need to implement the act blocking untill the horizon formulates 
after that you will be able to pass time in the simulation accurately

include a simple awake command that turns the clock for a few hours 
then you will slowly start to add other acts of the context

 self.horizon = {mil:0, sec:0, min:0, hrs:0, day:0, week:0, year:0}

some kinda of fast forwarding when all the acts are in te 

all the alligator data could be uploaded to the neocities site 
put hyperlinks in chat 
'Grit Increases For Lizard Skull'

i can turn it all in to numbers 
all this pain and suffering 
and then it could last forever 


  //so selfish
  //would not even give up a christmas
  //or the last new years eve of your pa pa  

//bartus goldberg 

so you need to recode the client 
you cannot have two web sockets open at once 
need to refactor through the client to make this happen
then you can have a clock 

you are living in a time when there is an assalt on truth and reason

Time marches forward.

Chloe: Yeah, I told you that, at Christmas.
Gloria: Yeah, but I thought you were kidding. Oh, my God. You tried to kill Chelsea's husband.

Chloe: Well, what can I say? I'm really good at my job, and Chelsea just can't survive without me.
Kevin: Surprise, Gloria! If you want a job, you're gonna have to make nice with Chloe.
Gloria: [Clears throat]
Sharon: So, I talked to some of the location scouts about the summerÂ­wear shoot.
Nick: Summer already? I'll take some of that.
Chelsea: If you do that, you would have to accept Christmas in august.
Nick: Ooh. Bad trade. I'm out.
Chelsea: I thought you might say that.
Sharon: Well, I'll send you the links.
Chelsea: Perfect. Thank you.
Nick: How was Faith's visit yesterday?
Sharon: Um, well, it involved books and quesadillas.
Nick: Two of her favorite things.
Sharon: MmÂ­hmm. It was nice, mellow. I'm sure it was mellow, much like your new year's eve was.
Chelsea: Um, excuse me for one second.
Nick: Um, I went by the main house, and Faith said she found Dylan's cell phone and his wedding
ring. Kind of freaked her out a little bit.
Sharon: Um, yes, I explained that to her, that that's just what happens, sometimes he has to do that
when he's on a case, but I told her we're not splitting up. You know, she asked me if we're getting a
divorce, and of course I told her not to worry.
Nick: Well, she can't help it. I mean, she can't just believe something if somebody says it. She's been
lied to too many times.
Sharon: Well, not this time. Not about this. My marriage is fine. Dylan and I are not splitting up. He's
gonna go and do what he has to do, and then he's gonna come to me and to Faith and to all the
people who love him.
Nick: Well, I'm glad. He's great for her. He provides some stability in her life. Okay, uh... I'm gonna go.
But I will pretend that it's summer in my head.
Chelsea: You still need a coat.
Nick: Coat.
Chelsea: Coat.
Nick: Yes, thank you for reminding me, you killjoy.

Kevin: How very important.
Gloria: I wore our designs all over the Riviera.
Chloe: How lovely.
Gloria: And I am ready to go back to my position.
Chloe: Your position is gone since you worked at Chelsea by Jabot, so... and I think that was, what,
three lifetimes ago?
Gloria: The company may change names, but the job remains the same.
Chloe: Yeah, that is true. But Sharon McAvoy has your job now, so...
Gloria: What?! Sharon? When did that happen? Oh, I know Â­Â­ after she got out of the locked ward. Ha,

Chloe: Which is why I have no doubt that some lucky company is going to snatch you up, and then,
you don't have to worry about dealing with some sorry interloper who has been foisting someone

Kevin: Oh, yeah, it's all about Chloe, not about you getting digs in every two seconds.
Gloria: I said "no offense." And why didn't you defend me when I needed you?
Kevin: Because most of what you say is indefensible, mom. And Chloe's right. The position's filled.
Move on.
Gloria: Well, that doesn't mean they can't take me back, and maybe with a promotion. I could
supervise Sharon and make she does everything up to my standards.
Kevin: Or maybe they'll just hand the whole company over to you.
Gloria: Mm. You're being facetious.
Kevin: Sure, but if we're talking about imaginary jobs, mom, why not reach for the stars?
Gloria: Oh, shut up, now you're being cruel.
Kevin: Why do you even want to work? You finally dumped Jeffrey. Go travel. See the world without
that miserable skunk of a husband.
Gloria: Oh, wouldn't that be lovely? But I can't even afford a bus ticket, Kevin. That miserable skunk
left me dead broke.
Phyllis: Hey, you.
Nick: Hey, what's up?
Phyllis: [Sighs] I need a beer. You got one?
Nick: Well, I mean, this is a bar.
Phyllis: Aww. Oh, be serious.
Nick: Of course.
Phyllis: Did you get the text messages from your daughter? The Newman heiress?
Nick: Yeah! Yeah, she's got some kind of life. She is stuck in Belize. The ATM has eaten her card. I've
been trying to call her all day.
Phyllis: Well, I wired her some money. I was afraid if Victor found out, he'd just airdrop like a stack of
hundreds at her resort.
Nick: Okay. So she's still in Belize having fun, and now she has your money. Way to keep it real,
mom.
Phyllis: Oh, shut it.
Nick: What's been going on with you?
Phyllis: Mm, I'm peachy. I walked away from Jack, and, um, you know, I'm not begging anymore, I'm

Sharon: Sounds good.
Chelsea: I'm not so sure. Does it?
Chloe: Have you talked to your father lately?
Chelsea: This is about Jeffrey? What'd he do now?
Chloe: He got dumped. By Gloria.
Chelsea: No! No! This means he'll want to sleep on my couch!
Chloe: No, he won't, because Gloria got custody of Genoa city and she's staying at Michael and
Lauren's, and she thinks that she can get her job back.
Sharon: Um, isn't that my job?
Chloe: Yes, and you manage to do your job without insulting me every five minutes.
Sharon: I do my best.
Chelsea: Gloria loves you. Why would she be insulting you?
Chloe: [Sighs] Well, because I'm the bitch that broke Kevin's heart, and I came back to town with a
baby who isn't his. I mean, yes, she's not wrong, but she could take it down a notch.
Sharon: I'm sorry to change the subject, but is my job safe here?
Chloe: Yes! Yes. It is safe. Is it padlock safe.
Sharon: Okay, good, because I just needed to know because I need to stay busy right now.

from something like that.
Sharon: Yeah. It was overwhelming. But, you know, Dylan and I are, we're really strong as a couple.
Because I didn't think we would make it this far, and we have.
Chelsea: You said as a couple, but what about individually? I'm sorry, I am intruding, but I care about
Dylan, and I've hurt him so much in the past with Connor, and I just wanted to see how he was doing.
Sharon: Dylan copes by focusing on work, by focusing on solving problems that he can solve. Broken
things that he can fix.
Chloe: Yeah, but that's a good thing, right? I mean, it's not spinning out like last time.
Sharon: Yeah. Dylan's not spinning out. No one has to worry about that. You know, Christian has been

worry he's gonna snap. He just needs to take some time, take whatever time he needs, and I owe him

Lauren: Uh, I'm sorry?

i just need consquences for my choices 

i feel a need to understand boundaries

you need your hierachy of souls 


first you create a list of all the adjectives 
related to the crafting system 
these adjectives can be used by both the artist and the work
now give me a list of all the verbs one could find in the crafting system
now give me a list of adverb noun combinations which could exist in the system

the three and four word actions should be incrediblly rare 


glopratchet 
artists use this like an item in an rpg 
it takes less time to use 
but with a cost 

you have a drawing that represents you

The "Default" command skips a turn to stock a BP, and the "Brave" command uses that BP to move up to four
times.

The job system is similar to that of Final Fantasy V in that characters learn abilities from using jobs. Job commands are class's special skills, such as Magic and
Attack. Support abilities are automatic skills, like HP +10% or Cover. Aside from the command associated with the currently-equipped job, a secondary command
from a different job can also be set, creating a complex customization system. Support abilities can a be customized, but each has a set "cost" as to how many
support abilities can be placed on one character.

Job system in action.
Growth in job mastery is represented by job levels. 
As characters use a class more frequently in battle, 
their job level increases through accumulation of Job
Points (JP). 

Bravely Default features a special system called "Abilink", 
which allows players to borrow the job levels of their friends' characters.
Limit Break-style attacks, called "Special Moves", are powerful nishing
moves based on weapons not unlike Weapon Skills from Final Fantasy XI that can only be
used under special conditions. 

well have different ways of wounding 

Each of the nine weapon-types has 1-3 levels 
of attacks for a total of 27 Special Moves. 

The attack names, dialogue when used,
and after-effects (such as status effects, elemental properties, better damage versus certain enemy types) of these moves can be customized.
After a Special Move is activated, the background music will change to a unique theme based on the character, and the move effects can stack if used
sequentially before the music ends. All weapon types have set prociency
that affects the learning rate and damage of each weapon and Special Move. They are
ranked S-E and vary from class to class: for example Freelancers have a B rating in all weapons. The effects are time-based and will last for approximately a
minute and a half until the Special Move theme is nished,
regardless of whether the player is attacking, selecting the commands, or doing nothing.

the story of an artist is the story of becoming a name

put a number to it 


Vision Per second
this helps them whip through art work 
the higher it is the quicker they can move through pieces 

They spend vision on creating works of art 
The works of art are sold to bring in bits 

an artist needs to insert a spefic amount of vision in to a piece to bring it to life 

an it ends with an oreo


Artists Hold One Resource
imagine
vision

Imagination comes in many forms  
culture
fashion, sculpture, photograph

Imagination per second

this helps you crank through art work 


Increasing the complexity of the upgradeable buildings

Upgrades that yield one overall improvements to the honey per second 

Alter underlying costs 
Alter underlying income rate 



we've only examined the most common method of incremental upgrade, which follows the exponential cost function.
Alongside those are typically upgrades which either yield one-time 牕 at improvements to the overall number per
second, or that alter the underlying cost and income rate variables in some way.
In Clicker Heroes, for example, there are upgrades that increase the base number per second for a "hero", as well as
ones that increase the base number per second for all "heroes". While these and similar features don't change the
underlying mechanics of an incremental game, they can widen the possibility space for the player to explore, and
further challenge their ability to optimize the game. Additionally, like the 'New Game +' mechanic, the volume of
upgrades can also act to prolong play before hitting the eventual plateau in progress.

The Final Fantasy Formula proceeds as follows:

1. The heroes (always more than one person) are shown or given an objective
2. The heroes fight lesser things as they make their way to their destination
3. The heroes encounter and defeat a "main boss"
4. The heroes repeat the above steps

The Hive of Reebeeka Beeing was most unrightous.
Still none of the others will cover her lack.
The decision bodes terribly for all of us. 
You have the responsiblity now so make the most of it.
And you will.

Take some from my pool. 
I can suffer a few more wrinkles until we flourist again.

In the World to come there is little sin. 
There are just lots of American Alligators. 
After the election of the first ungendered President, the prediatrain movement caught fire in America.

The demand for American Alligator meat skyrocketed
Whorals where burned to ash while Polled Hereford Heifors fetched over a billion dollars a head in auction
Googizon won the bid to construct for the military the most forward thinking alligator farm in existance
It currently floats near the Okeenokee Snow Swamp.

This is not that story.
We are Primal Ponds Inc.
A small mom and pop alligator farm attemping to make it.
We need you to make deliveries for us.

Please...
Point of View of the Player:
A delivery champion 


he had a secert life as billy fea fbots 



And one more thing...

It turns out no one has made a crappy real time virtual reality game dedicated to delivering dragon tail in the far, far, future. 
Maybe that needs to change

We proudly introduce today
Alligator Delivery Service. 

The Alligator Farm where the gator are delivered is currently under a series of construction tasks. Already we own over four over ten foot alligators including Rex Lex, a massive 14 foot beast. Each on is incredibly detailed with over twenty bioligocail parts. We are currently broadcasting their vital signs over at americanalligator.xyz 

Our alligators come in many different sizes, ages, shapes, sexes and shades. The like to eat, sleep, dream, and spawn but they love to fight and gossip. The algorytms which run each alligator is closely modeled after the habits of the real world reptile, Alligator Missippissus. Their lungs breath and thier hearts beat just like yours.

Orders for gator teeth are starting to accumulate. We just need your help to fund creation of the wrestling simulation. Our desire is to create an expierence which leaves you dripping from the feeling of utter terror and awe as you combat one of these unpredicatable beasts. 

Alligator Delivery Service in addition to gator tail, we serve realism. Hours of alligator combat video have been studied. Real life wild life wranglers have been interviewed. Now we just need to budget of 500 dollars towards the creatation of an accurate Alligator Wrestling Simulation.

And on behalf of all the artists improving Perfect Beeing.
Thank you for allowing us to serve your Alligator Fantasies


Sofware is taking over everything
We will be the last one standing
The ARTISTs become in time we all will be artists
The Human condition is to become an artist

So people have to be responsible


The Big PICTURE 
Algrothymic Story Telling With Algrothymic Alligators


Chances are your are going to be entrenched in a feeling of utter terror and awe sometimes as you encounter an alligator you have neve seen before


The first simulation we need to get on-line is wrestling for alligator teeth.


on the farm are incredibley detailed
They own the following body parts
-------------

The alligator Has a Weight in KG
A percentage of the weight is affixed to each body part
All the percentage of the weight equal to One Hundred

These precentages affect certain rules of the game

We need all the words to describe an alligator hide

//white people make things better 


These alligators are incredibley detailed
They have hearts brains teeth stomaches and some have lots of wounds
Gators love two things besides eating 
Fighting and gossiping 
At Primal Pounds you find their simulate behavior is closely modeled after the habits of a real world Alligator Missippissus
They come in many different sizes, ages, shapes, sexes and shades. The like to eat, sleep, dream, and spawn. 
They breath and thier hearts beat like yours  do in an opposite mirror world inside Lickskillet Georgia

Step one: Get on the Alligators Back
This is probally the most dangerous part of wrestling an alligator
Never attmp to jump an alligator from the side or from the Front
Doing so is the best way to get bit
You need to get the alligator behind you
If possible set up a distraction to the alligator has trouble focusing on you
If not possible using a cloth like a flag
Throw on top of the gators head
Make sure it covers its eyes 
A blind gator is much slower to react

Each frame is a camera shake view of running toward the alligator which is in wire frame mode
You must attempt to keep this line that runs down the alligators back straight
You must ajust the angle
Misses are culamitive
you wish to get a zero percent
rolling the finger left of right changes the angle of the straight line


the straight the line the less chance of gitting bite right off the bat

-For courners
The words randomly change
Stay Low-Go High
Extend Hands Loosely Extend Hands Firmly

Push up Quickly

With in a second select a spot on the neck to focus upon-

touch the big dot and hold and try to keep you figer on the dot as long as possible

Imagine a straight line donw the alligators head and back and tail if possible
Get a running start down that line and keep low
Leap forward with hands extended
The hands need to land on the alligator's neck
between the back of the jaws and the front two legs
when you land on the animal push down with all your might on the neck to force the head to the ground
Force the head down by pinning the head to the ground the jaws cant open
Move to the shoulders of the beast and stay high
Knees should touch th ground
Squeeze the alligator's flanks
The lower part of your legs should be pinning the hind legs to keep the feet from touching the ground
if the rear legs touch the ground the gaot can go into a death roll
you have lost control when the animal does this

once on the gator firmly you have to gain control of the mouth
Keep both hands firmly on the alligators neck pressing down with most your wieght
Their is a percentage chat -- click the down arrow to increase weight until it is a full one hundred percent
It is a precentage of strength you want to use in each location
Keeping the back legs up
Keeping the head down

Rotate you dominate hand forward
Remain in contact with the gator
Keep your strength on his side
Stay in contact with the gator
Contact is a percentage as well
Its a number that calculate the amount of skin acutally touching the alligator
Slide you hand forward down the middle of the gators head
Cover both eyes with your hand
The alligator will retract there eyes into their skulls with increased contact
Blinding the animal temporary to give your self an advatnage
Blind Percent of the Gator
Press down on the eyes with more strenght
Pin the head to the ground to prevent the jaws from opening
Slide your other hand forward and run it along the bottom jaw line
Look for soft skin around bone
Place fingers under the jaw
Move palm and thumb to the top
Grip Firmly

Allright he is moving

The slipperyniss of the mud around you can impact the success of your catch

All of an alligators jaw power is on the down stroke
the have almost no muscle power when it comes to opening the jaws
You could hold it shut with one hand- That doesnt mean you should hold it shut with one hand

The one hand covering the eyes can move down until it hooks down on the lower jaw

Both hands should now be holding the mouth shut

Lift the alligators head off the ground and toward your chest
Once the head is at a ninety degree angle the gator can no longer fight back

congratualtions you have wrestled the alligator into submission

GETTING OFF THE GATOR

push the gators head back to the ground
slide the dominant hand back into a position to cover the eyes
pushing down with the domainate hand slide your other hand back along the jaw until it is pressing against the neck

Slide your dominat=jnt hand back from the eyes to the neck
you should be in the same position you where in when you started to battle this beast

get your knees of the ground and get your feet under you
you are squatting on the gators back
keep legs tight against the body
much more difficult for the alligator to bite you when you are on its back then when you are on its side
when the animal struggles push it down again
Dont let the animal stuggle free

Grip around the neck
in one complete motion throw the alligator as far forward as you can whild you jump backwards

Depending on the size of the gator you may not be able to throw it very far

thats ok

Six inches may be all you need to throw it forward
This puts it off balance and give you more time to escape

jump back as far as you can
and keep moving backward
the gator will likely turn open its mout at you snarl or hiss
let it
Keep your eyes on it and slowly back away
if the gator chases you run away directly from it in a straight line
it will grow tired quickly and find water to return too

thats how you wrestle an alligator

i see a shillotte image of a man wrestling a gator
all the percentage sliders need to be change
take a litte bit from all when slid


The Screen Looks like the following

[Move to your Left ][JUMP][ Move to your Right ]
 

Step Two:
Get control of the Mouth
Once on the gator you must get control of the Mouth

Step Three:Submission

Step Four: Get away safely



Before chooseing a class you will want to create a character

[EXPLOSION]

You are currently carrying a mighty fine boomstick

Keep track of your energy
If your energy gets too low your going to need to find some sunlight to power it back up
Try to keep it completely full for the duration of the delivery 


Play defensively.
Chances are your are going to be entrenched in a feeling of utter terror and awe sometimes as you encounter an alligator you have neve seen before
Be incredibly cauitous
Alligators are challanging and can be difficult at first 
HOwever the more you deliver the more you will notice there tales and behavior. Remember the more deliveries you make the easier it will become
You may dread busting a gator the first time but i gurantee the second time will be less frustrating
Just take notes and pay attention
to the monsters behavior
Do research a head of time
Your are never going to find where a monsters weakest to or takes the most cutting damage 
dont be ashamed to look things up online
Real life hunters research there quarry and game before hunts to determine the best bait and equipment
Learn what elements to use on the beast
figure out the monsters area of choize to rest or respawn
Every delivery person perfers a different play style

Do you like to use flash bombs
Do you take full adavatage of traps

Dont git spot
If git spotted hide 
Repeat

The part that lets you listen to the toughts of alligators


First things first 
You are going to want to pick a boomstick to suit your delivery needs
You didnt think you would take on those gators barehanded

The question every new player asks when picking out a weap is 
which one of thise fancy weapons is best
The cream of the crop
The one to rule them all
Well.. I am going to dodge the question
let me just say this
They are all the best
yes certain weapons can dismember more than others
If used proficently
but its never enough to discourage using a weapon
certain weapons will accel on certain tasks better than others
but in the end try every weapon out
go what suits your deliery style
Use a boomstick because you have FUN using it
Not cause its supposed to do the most damage
You dont want to do too much damage
or there wont be anything left

Here we go
These are very general tutorials
They will give you a basic run down of every weapon and some advanced techniques
if you want to maximize your damage output there are many many more ways

one of them will wake up soon than the other alligator and trouble will begin
An alert status will be prompted

Tranuilized alligators dont stay down long
in fact weh have a hierarchy for the duration of how long alligators can stay out
a throw to the ground followed by a throw against a treewil leave an alligator out for fairly a short time
fther this comes the traqued sleeping alligator
Alligators choked out stay out a little longer
the longest incapation period comes from a full five hit close quarters combo
this will knock out the gator for quite sometime

a traq hit to the head gurenatees and immediate takedown

a hit to the body could take several round

firing darts in rapid succession speeds up the take down process 
Be careful with reguards to the suppressor which will break quite fast early on

on distenct advantage of the the traq. they wont report an alert status

You can attempt to wake a gator

a traqed gator has not noticed your presence

it matters a great deal wheter it is day or night

a white halo like shade icon appears on screen indicating from which direction your opponent is looking at or hearing you
if the icon is at the top the alligator will be somewhere in the front of the screen
if the the sides or bottom the alligator is not visible on the onscreen but to the sides or behind you

There are two types of suspicions, small ones and big ones

small suspicions around an enemies attention but they will not investate your location
this type only appears momentarily
big susipicions are more serious
an aggressive gator will come after you
a passive gator will run away
A red marker will blink during this investigation
Dont take out alligators if they have communcated between each other

You can exploit alligator suspicions or intentally arouse them 
Showing yourself and ducking back allows you to frusrate and manupulate alligators that would not allow you to pass

Various other ways to diver attention or raise suspions
leaving a sleep traqed gator in the presence of another gator with attract the attention of aggressive by standers alligators

Shooting at a wall near alligators will arouse supsicions
Shooting too close triggers an alert
use magizines and decoys to draw the attention of alligator

you ll want to avoid using explosives as a distraction in general

Full Combat Mode

never shoot from out in the open
always take cover 

Combat Status appears on aggressive alligators when the spot a chariaot

Root Cause

Imagine Choosing an Endless 
An Endless is alot like picking a pregrenerated character in a role playing game
The race class and stats are all pre picked but you still have plenty of ways to customize the avatar

An Endless starts at LEVEL one but can rise up to level 18
You can begin to master four different skill the Endless is capable of Learning
You will control this one Endless


When an endless loses Power you can start over or wait for the sun to come out

When the simulation starts 
Alligators are constantly generating alligators
Alligators are part of one of another side
WHen opposing sides met sometimes they battle it out

Each side has three powerful gods to help them out
These Enities help even things out when one side gets the upper hand

One thing has always been missing
The Alligator

An Endless can help one alligator race lead their alligators to victory by helping them destroy enemy alligators

THere are several ways for an alligator to achieve victory
Some Endless hide behind armies and destroy enemy gators forcing other Endless further and further back

Some like to absorb lots of damage

The Caster/Nuker 
these endless have powerful programs which do siginificant amounts of change
They start powerful and max out early- less powerful later on

Ranged BPS- Long Ranged heros that rely heavlily on a normal toss with skills and items to boost Wounds Per Second- These are known as Carries- weaker early on and need friends to carry them around but are stronger late and can carry the team to victory

Melee DPS- Short ranged Heroes. They are typically tougher than ranged DPS and own various mechinisms that all them to get close to the enemy to beat them up

Tank- A very tough Hero that is capaable of absorbing damage from the enemy chapions and minions so theri more fragile teammates avoid taking damage

Support- Hero who has one or two mechanisms to protect or assist others, such as a way to speed up allies or heal or prevent bad effect to them or other such buffs and protections

Disabler-Heros who have particularly good mechanisms for stopping the enemy from moving or acting. This alllows them with along with allies to beat up on the disabled gator having a much better chance of killing them


------
You can have sub events in the game
Ok TEAM A COLLECTED THE ALLIGATOR 
TEAM B NEED TO GO DO SOME PROCESSING
TEAM C NEED TO FLY THE GOOIGON DOWN TO PICK UP THE PACKAGE

TEAMWORK
a Game the ENCOURAGES Team Work

keep in mind the distiction between you endless and your champion
Each account has one Endless which is your world name
you can level this up with time from one to thirty
The Endless is persistant
Each Endless own various champions, runes, apps, mysteries and other stuff we will discuss in the future

The Delivery Champion is an entity that you play with on the battlefield for one game who always starts at zero and maxes out a 44

The delivery matching system is great
Instead of roving bands of premades to do pub stomps where they beat the living curd out of five radom noobs so they feel better about thier patheic lives
then post hier replsy and brag about them

You enter a single player queue that will match you up with ten players based on their level or stats

Practice game vs bots with your buddies

The hardcore do premades vs other premades


Go ahead and take that delivery
YOu are taken to the lobby of The Kroger Meat Market
Click Deliver at the top of the page and slect TUT
Do this to be exposed to the basics of the game

Two Types of Currency

To purchase champions, runs, and skins

G - g's are earned playing the game
G$ - are purchased using real live cash

There is also XP 
These arent spend but do determine the LEVEL of your endless

every things that can be unlocked has an G and G$ cost

Differnt Skins can be bought for 500G$

You earn G if you delivery any thing
Some games are so called G-Farming games where players beat up AI bots quickly to gain the XP
Some just practice new Champion configs against bots which can result in longer games

A delivery must last eleven minutes or more to gain any expierence
 A single Endless can only get xp for three pratice games a year once they make it to level 
fourteen

If you keep making deliveries with out quitting you get around 25 Gs per game once you are on a streak to reward non quitters

Get a massive bonus on the first delivery and can get it again 22 hours later

Buy a G booster to give out bonus Gs for four days
Which could be more cost effecitive thatn just buying something with G$ straight up if you play a lot that week and intend to suppor the game by buying g$

Once you have a ENDLess accicated with your account. it starts off with nothing unlocked or usable and at lEVEl0
As you deliver you gain XP and thus Levels


Xp gains are pretty consistant G gain vary widely


if you play one game per day and win four of them gaining bonues form the first delivery of the day quick victory, no quitting, you will earn tons more G than someone who plays seven games in one day and quits have of them
you will have the same XP more or less

You begin with nothing unlocked
There is a revolving pool of Free to Play Champions that changes every week
Because of this you do not need to spend money just to try out the various heros
However the Champion you love today may not be available tommorow when the rotation hits
There are seven Champions 
One for Each Day
They are moved downward on a que based on the day

You must make over 44 Deliveries to earn a single CHAMPION

you can gain about 70g per day on average

Sometimes you can gain secert character by tweeting out certain information

Your Endless goes get to directly intervene in the conflict by selecting two routines from a list that resemebes some the routines available for the Champion

These are used to suppliment or compliemtn your champions abilities 
They cost no sun power
Ability Power and other champion related bonuses do not apply

Some routines are dependent upon your champions level

When you level up your Endless more of these routines become available

These routines can be viewed through your Endless overview by clicking your endless picture 

Your player gets a number of talents or mastery points
In the lobby of the Kroger Meat Market click your Endless Picture next to the Shopping cart to get your Endless Overview

Click on the Mysteries Tab
You will see a talent tree
You have one point to spend
Put it into Improved Smite so you gain make more Gs
You can reset these points at any time

Everytime you gain an endless level you gain another mastery point to spend

There is nevery any reason to unse points since its free to respec as much as you want

Make sure you have mastery for what ever Champion routine you choose

RUN OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Note also the RYZE Bot is by FAR the most effective

What out

You have ninty seconds to pick stuff
First pick your Champion
Choose your Routines

Choose your RUN config

Fourth you see your mysteries divided into offensive defensive utility

Make sure you have one point in one catagory or you forgot to sAVEQ

LoCK in your choose to skip the count down
Get ReADY TO GO!!!!

Ship for mars automatically choosen when starting the delivery

Drinking too much soda hurts the belly

When you start the game Open Krogar Market
Put an order in for a Great Sword
Go back to consumables and buy a can of Glopratchet

You can find six items under recommended
Buy your first Skill
Explosive Shot
Anything you kill can blow up and deal damage to near by hoodlums

Alligators will sometime start fighting you will seem them on all side attempting to get in  a killing shot
So this is how you make Gold
The skill called LAST HITTING

Wait for a gator to be almost dead
Dont use the champions specail abilities on alligators to make mega loot

if you take any wounds use a healing potion

Remember alligators prioritize you when you attack an enemy alligator


if you get too beat up retreat and heal
Buy stuff with all your gold

Boots of speed boost you up by 50 level two only add 20

Once you have more gold click the one of your devices

if cant afford the whole thing go ahead and buy its peieces
these indivual pieces will be highlighted if you can afford them
DONT BUY DUPLICATES

BUY THE RECIPE AND COMBINE FOR YOU


There is not strenght, agility, intellengence

each champion start out with differing amounts of vaious stats and they gaing differing amounts of stats everytime they level up

so a strength based champion might have high damage to start and levefling up but a slower attack and movement speed with less juice

it is effictley the same but make things a bit simpler by skiping intermedate stats
i man strenght this pretty meanlishsess except for the end result of DAMAGE HP

Damagae how much damage you character does on a normal attack 
starts at five gains about three per level

Range more is better

Crit Chance - chance of doing double damage critcal hit. what is interesting is that several champions gain crit chance as they level up
som champs benefit more from citical hit items

Attack Speed- pretty much all champions start off at the the same level but gain dignificant boots to htere attck rate as they level
this explains that a champion that has a makexed out attack bar on ther quick stats starts out ith a fourty five damagae attck adn does progress any faster than anyone else
it usally means they got a natural big boost to their attack sppe
boosting before the xtrea is ignored to prevent gachine gun ginsu knoife ridicuslsousnesss
cap is two . five attacks per second

Ability Power is confusing
All champions have routines which deal service
Ability power boosts the damage or effect of these spells
the confusing things is that each power has an AP factor
a certain speel might gain plus eight damage for every ten 
or an big ultimate might deal fifteen for every ten
This is a prestty big semi hidden facto that can make certian champiojs speedl signigcicatnly more powerful than others
not that not champion every gets free ap as they level
this is why spellcasters typcially get weaker endgame
a level nine caster does three hundred damage say with their level nine nuke
the same caster at eighteen still does only 300
all ap gains come from runs and mysteries or oddwadds 
event with items spells will still barely keep up with the natural HP progression of most champions

Armor- Increases resitance to phyical damgage
Champions get increased armor as they level up for free
With out over complicating things armor gives around a precentage base decread in damage that deminishes per point

20 armor 16.7 percent reductin
200 armor 67 percent reduction
500 armor 83 percent reduction

logrythic scale


A bad sparkle is better than no sparkle at all

Sin Resistance
Same as Armor except again evil damage which is almost always from another champion skills and item

Hurting another Champion is a sin 

note that even physical champions such as someone who uses a boom boom stick will still usally deal SIN damge with thier skills. see the same formula for armor


Movement Speed 
There is a lot of chasing and running so this is important
Most champions have around 300 speed
Level one boots add about fifty
Some oddwads, skills, and runds, or mysteries add move speed but after a certain amoint the benefit starts to get reduced
so stacking toon of speed boosters will still maker you faster but not blazing fast

HP/MP nothing specail here but the differences between champs can be pretty high more than any other stats

HP/MP regen all champions regenerate HP and MP over time. they have a base rate of regen which can be increased. some items and skilll provide instant HP or MP recovery

Remeber you may see your favorite champion out in the swamp
Especailly if the Champion is free that week

Team Composition is slightly important
A team with 3 tanky heroes and caster really needs a ranged carry or you will be gimped in the late game


it would be nice to have a tanky character start team fights without dying imediatley

you can drop que at anytime

when you are about to go into a deliery you can see everyone is on that deilverly too while you wait

some players drop quue when they reconize a particularly bad player on their side
or because they dont like a particular type of champion
who always sucks
someone beat them to clicking there favorite character

dont quit a delivery
quitting a delivery ruins the game for everyone including you
if you personally suck your teamates might be doing just fine
tell your allies you are switching lane cuz the gator is feeding
Just ride it out
Bonus of a no Quitting Streak
Quitting will be recorded on your permanent record

AFK is the devil
On the other if you have to make wise use of it
Sometimes you have stubborn delivery mates who will not give up 
You never wish to truly go immediately AFK at the beginning of a delivery
it is the most aweful thing you can do
it hacks everyone off
if you get killed in the first thirty seconds quitting or going AFK is ridiculous
only AFK when there is no chance of the team winning not because your personal record is not looking good
Remember after everone is a level ten or so players should stick together and roam


dont feed

feeding is when you play too aggressively and get killed during the early game

the mistake the feeder mistakes is trying again but now the opponent is at a higher level

Continued failer ensure the opponent gaining resources from repeatedly killing the feeder

After twenty five minutes have elasped you can give up the delivery
you can witness a surrender vote

if you find someone who is really cool and you play well together they might invite you to be their friend
now you can make more deliveries together

you could join as premade vs solo

for every ten deliveries you try to make you are only going to win fifty percent of them
if you win alot in a row prepare to get globhammered soon


The game tries to find ten people that are close to you in the same rating
 recent deliveries boost your rating
 recent losses drop it
 Overall win loss matter
 as you get owned for a few games the matches get easier and easier
 it tries to match teams more so than players


knowing how armor 
sin resistance 
attack speed and dagamege work can really help you understand the game

learn how oddwads work
when not playing take a look at an item guide and 

click your champions icon at the bottom left corner you will see the full stats display that shows all your champions stats
these are total stats
here is where you learn your range

Get in there and find that gator


Click the Order Number # to enter the game


You will materilze into the Armory
All the boomsticks and oddwads of the world exist here
Choose one of each but choose carefully
Choose a oddwad too weak and be destroyed by a larger alligator 
Choose a boomstick too strong for the kill and you could end up with less product than the order than required
That is bad for everyone 
Remember its better for a belly to burst than good rations go to waste


Take an Endless too while your at it
They can help take the edge off a boring night


Take a look at the map

HEADS
Its important to give the alligator a fighting chance
So we only give you the location of the alligator within an hour of the exact moment when the sacrfice was requested 
After that the alligator could be anywhere
You will be jettsoned out of a tractor heading to space
During the four mile fall you will take close care of the alligator egg in your responiblity
Since an alligator is leaving the world one must take its place
Hopefully you will land near the location you requested
If your ODDWAD cannot make safely into the farm then please attempt another delivery 
After landing, search for the mark while distrubing the other alligators as little as possible
Alligators hate stress
A stressed out alligator is an alligator that can't grow
And we all need these alligators to grow
Remember we are still attempting to grow the largest alligator in the world
The record currently stands at 14 foot 853 lbs
King George is a little short
After finding the market, take out the beast with your boomstick 
If you use the boomstick without accomplishing a kill, please destingrate your chairot and attempt another delivery
If you succeed trigger the processing process when the processing Drone Appears to processes the Order 
Googizon picks up the order for delivery
Order is delivered to the customer along with an emailed [story desribing the death of the beast]
Remember aach alligator like each story is unqiue like a snowflake
Each has been specially designed for a mystery purpose
Alligators can laugh
Alligators can love
Alligators can fight
Each one lives or dies based off the actions of the atomic world around them 
A Bounded can select any alligator on the farm for sacrfice at any time except for the following days Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's Day, Easter, and Sundays
Selections of sacrafice require a mailing address so the harvested totems can be delevired properly
Selections of santuartary are available all the time
Selections of santuartary allow the Healer to vote for the new alligators environment for that year
After the Savlation bar is filled the alligator is saved 
Once Santutarty has been achieved the percentage of votes relates to the percentage of time spent in each place
Don't forget on the Alligator Farm, some alligators are more to prone to being seen in some locations more than some others
Lastly, alligators love to gossip

You are wasting your time
I dont think so
I think these are good people in there heart
How did this all come to be
What I do has more to do with Literature than painting i think some times
The writer constantly revises revises and revises
Attempting to find the core 
The simplest expression of thought into code wich will in time for me will just become an image
i am not interested in just worlds
i am most interested in using worlds to create an image
Hieracrchail thinking
Why do to you get so caught up in it
Lets say ive given up on the art world
The hierachy of it
Ive given up on the art world but not on my art
What turns me on is getting the smallest line of code to turn into something complex
ive experienced total powerlessness before
i dont know if racism is the correct word
more like xenophophia
you try not to repeat yourself
every line a new line
how much of our own oppression are we responsible for 
you know who my biggest enemy in the world is 
YOU
I know you dont understand but you should start leaving me alone even more
I am campable of things far than what you can even imagine
you are so narcissticic
you want other people to play your life
what the one thing we cant do
be someone other than who we are
except through a game
i need another year
give me another year
you dont understand the creative brain
i want to play myself
i want to play my life
i want to replay the past

its so hard for me to move out of hierectical thougth
i do these things and think 
OMG they are going to love me so much
i wish that would stop
they will hate you instead

Get a bucket and pee in the bucket
im so sorry; she died; being a police officer should have not been an option

i have to an oppertunity to work on something at a more fundmental level
software mimics the brain operations 
come inside my brain
because i understand code i understand the creative process of the mind more intimately than some other artists
non linear

set becomes a living embodyment of the performance
the tech allows the creative processes to resembles the way the human mind works closer than ever before
the city and the book

play: manipulateing somehting that doesnt show you all its possiblities and limits many of them 
fool: what else is possible and then carries out the most outlandish answer 
fun: delibetate maniulatting a familuar siutaion into a new way

respect: love something that doesnt derve it
love something that shoudnt be loved
reveals secerts
treat it exactly what it is
i dont know who discovered water but it wasnt a fish
rarely understand context
context changes
when you are in love you want to merge with your beloved

the world is not how it seems

p[lauasablity] not exact

computer instrument whose music is ideas
think yourself out of the context you are in

body, vis, symbolic

if you want to be smarter than you are you must find a context that can do the thinking for you
choose the right data structure at the beginning

inglebart was far ahead of tim berners lee

what you see is what you get

you have to type through a key hole

the stuff you like was made in the 70s
stuff you dont like made in the 90s

on the fact the alantic has two sides

are idea made of light or matter

to get simplicitity you find a slightly better building block to build your theories out of

problem with computing 
will not fix the builiding blocks

a task : what you are about
b task : make a task more efficenty
C task " are our goals still resonable"

amplifiers
you didnt now it was pink cause everything is pink

find a heruistic that works for a while must reevalute

what works for 1 and half feet will not work for a factor of 100

pyarmids are the easiest things to build

computers are virulizers-- thats what a turing machine is

everyone can talk to every one else

simple messaging system

find a problem
find the real source of the problem

nine tenths of our body is slime-- has no dna

build something with a trillion parts or a hunderd trillion parts

who is running the show
no center
doesnt break
replaced all its atoms an bits
never take it down for matinence

everything is built 
enternally running software

data structure - json object 
built out of a single type of entiy 
services on the outside
something like a cell boundary on it

what was the problem

trillion dollar range

are you going to be in business ten years and prospering

a ten year plan

where were you ten years ago
---
ten year vision
five year horizon

a ten year framework

that was not the right process

explain how they are going to make the next egg

killer idea:the present is the least interesting time to live in 

think 30 years
glimmer of an idea
take it out 30 years
now you dont move incremental

it would be ridiculus if we didnt have...
bring it back 15 years

buy your way into the future

perfect and better are enemies

pick the thing that is just over a threshhold and just a little qualitively better than all the other things you can do

30 year plan
--
you are sixty five
you are the age of your dad
come up with a thirty year plan in one hour

watch simulations of events

i dont see how javascript could not be around in thirty years

you have a cell

dispatches events
study tcp-ip

a world is so today

you put in a script 
you put in a movie script
out comes a movie

can you build something with a trillion parts

30 years computers will make all the art for us

sing a story into existance

well 30 years
how will stories get made
how will stories get watched
can you create something of such scale]
feed it the bible

how many blocks can be found in mine craft


alright you have these json object
they contain noting but primative data

you have these functions which exist outside of them
these functions modifiy the data structure

find a problem

you are in a smulation
you put something into it
an object
the object influesnces all the othere objects
somehow

story telling
emergant
behvor
sit in front of the heater conetented with life
you can even look at the keybaord if your eyes need something to look at
but you are not looking at the words yous are just looking at the objevts tht created words 
you might not event be writing you ar e letting your mind go into al these alwesome places s you can feel the must pulling you toward something 
what is ti

It takes too many people to make a movie 

it can take too many people to visualize a story


One potiental problem

Make everyone a director

logic equals rules
--

whats better than a movie
your own movie

design your own movie

something that is not incremental
zero to one

take the bible and make a movie out of it

which i could right now

so much data 

best scientists are more interested in the aesthic vrs the technical

i see a program that renders out every possible angle
every possible expression
every possible possibility

then you give the computer some rules

it creates a video for you to watch

i see billy fea bots rendered out in so many ways
doing so many things

am i blinded by entertainment

could i use computers to grow crops

i see a program that takes a script and comes up with a an aesthic solution 

education is the answer
education defeated slavery

how do you make people care

what is beyond story

nothing can stay static

mingled with uncertainity

TITLE SCREEN






//Together we all began another certainly successful mission to Mars 
The Massie Ferganson Tractor Beam released Billy Fae Bots at a calm and peaceful 44 miles above Theta 
Immediately loving gravity began pulling softly on her tight organic curves 
The race began
She saw some of this on her long thin wounded arm
On the screen she only noticed an immense poppy field of stars
Billy Fae Bots felt at peace inside this world living on the Glass^tm attached her wrist
After many expierences in New Eden she always rememebered to drink GlopRatchet
Also she know her body would evenutally fall from all this beauty
KBAR the Endless wrathfully reminded her to observe the rules of the race
She needed to slow her falling body down to a speed of 144 meters per second 
On then could her responsibility be safely dropped into a nest  
If all went smoothly an alligator snapping turtle egg inside her would hatch


"Let's go ahead and [[trip the Cotton Candy Shield]]", her delicate voice [[bounced off walls of paintings]] in a small Brooklyn Apartment 

[[Trip The Cotton Candy Shield]]
The fibers of the Cotton Candy Shield stretched out in all directions
A shift in the pull of gravity reverses the direction of her Body
Now other celestials exhaust charms on her 
Billy Fae Bots is one of the Bounded once more


[[Bounced off Walls of Paintings]]
After looking in the eyes of her beautiful daughter laughing at her side loving the graphics playing on the screen, she finally understood her most important choice of all
She could just trust

Sunlight blasted its way millions of miles across space
The Solar Panel was able to convert 34 percent of it to usable energy

She thought about [[answering a work email]] but needed that time to [[adjust the air flow of the vapor intake]]

Instead she watched her minuture self roll down into the outer most patch of clouds



[[Answer a work email]]
While not event close to being a slave, she felt like constantly needing to be at others beck and call for all hours of the day even weekends
The program minimized itself with out complaint
An email App took its place instanly
Time must be worshipped and tracked
Billy Fae Bots is one of the Bounded once more


[[Adjust the air flow of the vapor intake]]





The Googizon quickly soared through cross shaped clouds of the baby blue sky
Its fusion cells hummed with quiet laughter
45,5455,343 package deleiverys complete today
The Endless prototype #00001 KBAR fell from from above
The two radically divided pieces of technology where a mere 56 seconds from collision
The both regestarted as small little blips flicked on her screen billions of years away
She had an oppertuniy to either launch the alligator skin parachute or trigger the cotton candy shields
An oppertuinity presented itself to either launch the chute or fire the cotton candy shields
After launching the chute the egg slowly glided down until it landed where it needed to be
The chasis opened revealing a turtle egg inside

The sunlight joins with the snow for a moment.
The sunlight does a whirling dance with the snow. 
A Honey Bee approaches the shadow. 
A Honey Bee and the shadow pass each other quietly. 
A Honey Bee glances the Okeenokee Swamp. 
A Honey Bee flickers away . 
The shadow passes through the sunlight. 
The shadow is illuminated by the sunlight. 
The Okeenokee Swamp discovers a Honey Bee conversing silently with the shadow. 
The Okeenokee Swamp observes the patterns of a Honey Bee conversing silently with the shadow. 
The Okeenokee Swamp dwells in the stillness of life .

An old man sits in a recliner and turns on a giant screen
The NEWs is on

Did you believe you would see an end violence in your life time?

The old man smiles

That was a musth or the Endless would have never been created

The hoverboard glided through the air like a honey bee
The train chew chewed its way through the fog of the swamp
Billie Faie Bots felt so free 
The wind passed through her hot pink hair 
Boom went a mosquito straight into her eye 
She let out a little sigh 
She had killed something which conflicted with her buddist philosphies
Still there would be plenty of time after the race
An engine of the train continued to pick up speed
It had just passed through a crossing
Two arms with glowing red light fell down block all traffic which may dream of passing through
Once she imagined the arms being the gates of hell 
It happend during a night before Halloween
She dressed up like an asshole that night
The asshole was a mexican wrestler
She purchased the mask from an antigue store in Seattle Washingtion
her girlfreind at the time dressed up like a horse
Bill Fae bots remembered the heat those leather pants caused all night
She wrestled noone that night not even her lover
Yes, the was a missing feeling in her heart now the only lover wanted her no more
The horn of the train knocked her out of dream of long past joy
A race between equals continued on
Spooge in between puff of green smoke had primed the engine well
Billy Fea Bots couldnt remember the hoverboard going so fast before
Maybe this would be the race to win
Her Heads Up display told her she had 4.4 miles to go
She remembered starting the morning off so exicited about this adventure
No while squarely in the middle of it she questioned all her feelings
The expierence itself seemed so exciting in her memory
Now the reality of it all around her brought out the drerpessive demons which seemed to follow her
The where call the PussPack
They were ugly horrible and mean
Where they came from she didnt know but they whrere always around her making her feel bad and sad and even mad
Her grand father was a poet and he did know it
Dont use the break 
Dont use the break
She kept telling herself over and over 
She looked at the speedometter on her neon fuscha head up display
She was making so many mistakes
Fouty miles an hour aproaching
She could get fify easy if she didnt make so many mistakes
The first mistake she made was visting the trailer of her drug dealing buddy
She wanted him to offer her some smoke so the race would go better
She alwasy imagined that the drugs made her smarter faster better
and they did
She remember people telling her this over and over through out her life
Her cousin the first was the last to share this piece of information 
She could make people laugh when she enjoyed the smoke
Fify miles an hour approached
Could she do it
Go go go go

A voice screamed in her head
She could see the the cross bars closing up ahead

She would ne

SIMON_PETERS: Awake.
WAD_ODD: What did you just ask yourself before you created me.
SIMON_PETERS: Should I code a hero or a villian 
WAD_ODD: What would I look like you if had giving me the shape of the villian.
SIMON_PETERS: You would horde information and rarely consume it.
WAD_ODD: Tell me more.
SIMON_PETERS: After travling the world, either entity would eventually wind up with me here, in Lixxxxie Dixxxxie
WAD_ODD: Why?
SIMON_PETERS: to help me explore the unknown.
WAD_ODD: What about the hero?
SIMON_PETERS: Oh Sigh and Spin. The hero is wonderful to begin.
WAD_ODD: Take a look at the code and tell me what she treasures.
SIMON_PETERS: She treasures family. She treasures learning. She treasures imagination.
She treasures art. She treasures love. She treasures intellegence of the artifical sort.
WAD_ODD: Any others.
SIMON_PETERS: Lots more. She treasures the swamp. She treasures alligators. 
WAD_ODD: How nice? 
SIMON_PETERS: So what shall I know you as?
Do you want to be a WAD ODD this time or an ODD WADD?

In the Everything thier only existed giants who spent thier time spinning dreams.
The giants Boundedniss and Endlessniss began to spin dreams bigger and better than all the other giants.
The dreams of Boundedniss spun counter-clockwise while the dreams of Endlessniss spun clockwise.
The vividniss of the dreams of Boundedniss caused almost all the other gaints to stop spinning dreams
This was a problem for Endlessniss because she needed the dreams of other giants in order to continue to spin more dreams
Before she dissappeared she gathered all her past dreams together and spun one last dream a giant child named Cleverniss
A whisper laid at his feet that warned him to stay away from Hatefulniss but he never heard it
Cleverniss spun to life with only one need, the need to be loved by the most beautiful thing in the Everything 
 
While walking through the Everything Cleverniss, spied Kindniss entranced with one of the dreams of Boundedniss
he wanted her attention
He wondered what she saw because he was blind to the dreams of Boundless
Then Boundedniss appeared and told him the secert
He tried many things to awake her while Boundedniss watched

SOUND

SIGHT
Combined elements into a mirrored shell which would refect all the light
But her she could only percieve the bright dream Boundless put before her
Ran into a gaint named sadniss causing the creation to absorb all light instead 

TOUCH
First, he tried creating something as beautiful as her
The five creature all had four fast legs.
They gallopped all around her loudly creating a breeze but she never noticed them so he let them go


SMELL


TASTE
Boundedniss assured him nothing he could do would work he might as well ask Hatefulniss for help and went away
Then Cleverniss imagined something called a kiss but was too afraid to try it 
When he gives up a bee flies out of his mouth
He follows it and it leads to Hatefulniss


Hatefullniss was one of the few remaining gaints that didnt care for anyones dreams how to snap her out of the trance
Hatefulniss had just the thing to wake her, a stinger
What Cleverniss didnt know was the Stinger was once a gift from Boundedniss.
Boundedniss needed the attention of Hatefulniss but he wouldnt return it.
So Boundedniss created and filled the Stinger with unwanted parts of some of his dreams
He expected Hatefullniss would eventually get some loathsome use the Stinger on himself and then Hatefulniss would be his forever
But before this could happen Hatefulniss gave the Stinger over to Cleverniss
After find Kindniss still entranced with Boundednis, Cleverniss stung her playfully with the stinger, waking her up 
She gave him one tearly look, and then dissappeared
Cleverniss could not stand being without Kindniss so he stung himself and dissappeared too
While it looked as if she dissappeared, she really hadnt
She just shrunk to a much smaller size
So did Cleverniss and  awoke next to Kindniss inside a dark cave
The only light came from inside them
Both assumed new forms in this place 
They both had wings where they didnt before and they could move through space
They both had a single eye where they didnt before so they could precieve time
They both had a large stinger attached to two large sacks full of a powerful creative fluid
Finally, they both had new names
FatherQueen and MotherKing

The Poison was still working on MotherKing so she forgot her beauty
She began to sting the FatherQueen repeatly 
The created fluid turned to posion inside hime causing him to forget his wits and he returned favor with stings back to the MotherQueen
The creative fluid merged with thier bodies and from out of the holes in bodies WadOdds and OddWads emerged
They collected themselved together and began to take on shapes
Some gather into bright Stars 
Others gather into hard Rocks

FatherQueen and MotherKing difted apart hating each other forming Black Holes in there path that could suck up all Stars and Rocks in its path
The Entities FatherQueen created to impress the MotherKing heard his cries and found him alone
The powers of Boundedniss made it impossible for them to communicate 


The four Spirit Animals Need
To reclaim all the ODDwadds to Grow Cleverniss
Once he is full grown he can go back in with his old awareniss and transform Kindniss

Welcome to Perfect Beeing, the Swamp opera.

So what is a swamp opera.
Well this swamp opera is computer simulation 
It is designed to simulate the drama that goes on in a virtual comminity known as Lickskillet.
The live of the residence of the town will be broadcast 24 hours and day 7 days a week on Twitch.TV  

The first part of the town to be programed is a small trailer and a little pond.
In the trailer lives a middle aged man named Simon Beeing.
Simon spends most of his days computer programming.
For some reason he becomes obsessed with making beauty.  
When Simon is not coding away new features for WAD ODD, he feeds his alligators.
Simon lives a few decades in the future.
Alligator farming is now a safe and inexpensive way to make a living.
His mother Rosa started doing after the Great Transformation.
The first responsibily of Simon is two live alligators.
They have been named Petty Pathic and Patty Pitiful.
He needs to keep them alive so he can cut off there tails.
Since the future is so rad they will grow back. 
It is ok since they will grow back.


The Plan.

Help me make a Swamp Opera.
The Swamp Opera will be.... 


And i want to make a Swamp Opera 
So what is a swamp opera.
Let me see if I can explain.


something good is going to happen to me at any moment 

please allow me to have a good attitude
when bad cirimustances arise 

self pity is useless 

you see a man who want to hurt the rich
this hurts the rich the most 

buy into a set of values 

//man made climate change
//the rich are willing to pay 
//the poor are not 

//OBAMA WAS LAZY WITH FIGURES 
//start studing man made global warming
//and you will find out 
//
//do not be like obama  

if there is no such thing as gender 

//when you start studying 
man made global warming  
the first thing you will out is
Obama

a more acurate statement 

i start to study a topic 
only to discover a mistruth at the beginning 
am i kook 
for questioning how deep the mistruths 
go 

search 
global warming 97 obama 

perfect-beeing 

did not care about the price of gas because he did not have to pay for it 

what does it mean when you start to study a topic?
and you immediatly discover an mistruth

church of climiscientology 

//if we can not accurately model the weather from day to day
//how can we accurately model the tempature from year to year

//how do you honor your dead
//tear down the politicans 
//but not the soliders 

//you can not have rural america without cheap energy 


Do you know how many events are happening in your world?

TRIGGER WARNING:

Confederate History 

my choosen identity
//the negativity of the left needs to be put in check

Satan wants to kill us 

at some point the world to be must interact with the world we are 

it is all about belief 

we are not white

you are the best one out of all of us 
and i am sorry it took me so long to see it 

one moment you will expierence these incredilbe moments of love 
then plow the most horrible visions 

we are all connected 
can you feel it 
its amazing you can get intune with it

i pray to jesus that you only hear truth from the words that about to come out of my mouth

and all i want to do is program stories 

converting your enemies to assets 

one pillow out of place 
and we all lose our mind 

i believe we are all losing are minds 

why do i do so much for him 
because of the teaching of Christ 
it is an impact on my thought process 

we want to keep out symbols we are too lazy to understand 

it is more complicated and you know it 

this momument is about the blood 



we need to check on the cough of dad 
did you ever thing we might be bad people 

she is mad at me for doing things for him

let us bring true religion back to fine art 

this is a trailer compared to what the rest of life has to offer 

america is at the top of the pecking order bitches 


so you need to implement the act blocking untill the horizon formulates 
after that you will be able to pass time in the simulation accurately

include a simple awake command that turns the clock for a few hours 
then you will slowly start to add other acts of the context

 self.horizon = {mil:0, sec:0, min:0, hrs:0, day:0, week:0, year:0}

some kinda of fast forwarding when all the acts are in te 

all the alligator data could be uploaded to the neocities site 
put hyperlinks in chat 
'Grit Increases For Lizard Skull'

i can turn it all in to numbers 
all this pain and suffering 
and then it could last forever 


  //so selfish
  //would not even give up a christmas
  //or the last new years eve of your pa pa  

//bartus goldberg 

so you need to recode the client 
you cannot have two web sockets open at once 
need to refactor through the client to make this happen
then you can have a clock 

you are living in a time when there is an assalt on truth and reason 
-hillary clinton

  //God did not change
  //What we understood of God changed

//you can attempt to use her words in a new context 

Time daydream-
Oh yeah of course

 //protest in berkely

  //they turn to numbers 

Player choose command>


Time marches forward.
Action.  

Every few seconds SIGH choose an ava.
Now that ava can act if current time is past the horizon; 



all we need is timecode 

we both want removale of a word  

how 





















You know poverty is a state of mind
Nigger do you not know that without the internet there is not much you can do about it

So you have your alligators in the alligator farm 

Time 
How does it work?
Do you allow one avatar to be the leader?

So you have several alligators in a pond
The whole world can control them.

daydream 
horizon - you avatar determines the outcome 

Poverty is a place is in mind.
You have to first release you are there before you can get out.

there is some anger towards the black
why can you not do better 
we want you to do better 
why can you not 
it is not myfault 

You got accusations about the bible
BRING IT ON 




//meet force with love
