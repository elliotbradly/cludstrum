the old dawgs at the end of the street 
you get him 
no why do you get them 
why dont we all go get them 
alright 
maybe just this time 

said the mother at the side of the kings 

homer says child hood is over
time for some work


microsom of the human race 

so he took a step outside 
now wide eyed for a little while then what 
maybe not too much suffering 

seriously 
where are we going with this thing 

the alligator egg falling game 

what kind of nonsense would go in there 
que the space music 

first of all i am going to need to watch my data and my dad 
so let us look at our words

alrighty 

we render out a new picture 

now what 

we make a story 

about what 
we start to plan it out 
we start to make it out 

do you want to start the story with a dream squence

no

we want to go straight for the action

    alrighty 
    here i am stuck 
    waiting for the inspiration to change 
    the next function 
    once this function is completed 
    then i will need to come back to the world 

  it is the function that advances time 
  once you can advance time 
  then you could put out path blockers
