     mundane physical or mental disadvantage is plausible,                          First, we define “humanity” in terms of intelligence.
                                                                                The human brain’s thinking capacity depends on having a

minimum size and mass. You can shrink the body but not
the head, as in a human dwarf, but there is a limit to how
big a head can be supported on a shrunken neck and
spinal column without causing problems. Alternatively, if
the size of the head is reduced proportionately to the rest
of the body, intellectual capacity will decline. Fortunately,
intelligence appears to be a function of brain area rather
than mass or volume, so reducing brain mass does not
result in a direct, linear drop in IQ.
  Second, a scaled-down human loses heat more rapidly,
due to his larger body area in relation to his mass. This
means he will need to eat rapidly in proportion to a normal-
sized human just to keep his body temperature up. (This is
why small mammals like mice are almost always either eat-
ing or sleeping.) Even so, overall food consumption will be
notably lower (as it eats smaller meals). It might be a good
idea to add Fur (to preserve heat) or a longer sleep cycle to
any miniature human. Miniatures will eat many small
meals, and get hungry if they miss them.
  Third, while a smaller size is handy in terms of reduced
life support requirements, it is also inconvenient for many
other activities, from reaching things on a shelf to finding
clothes that fit. It also correlates with reduced Strength.

  Many of the materials we use are biological in origin.
By modifying the organisms that make them, we can pro-

with improved properties. Designers can even come up
with new materials and the creatures or plants to make
them.

Interferon (TL8)
  Interferons are a family of related proteins that are nat-
urally produced in the body to boost the immune system to
fight viruses. A variety of synthetic genetically engineered
variants exist. They are used to treat lingering diseases,
notably viral hepatitis, and also other hard-hitting viral
infections, multiple sclerosis, and some cancers. A typical
course of treatment involves regular injections over 4-12
months. The first injection often produces flu-like symp-
toms (fever, chills, aches) lasting four to eight hours. These
may disappear as the body gets used to the extra interfer-
on, but often persist for the course of the treatment.
  Natural interferon is available in tiny quantities in TL7
on an experimental basis. Interferon treatment using genet-
ically-engineered synethetic interferon is available at TL8
for about $2,000/month. LC4.
  If someone is diagnosed with a disease treatable by
interferon, the GM should require two HT rolls, one at the
start to avoid side effects, the other midway through the
program to see if they responded. If the HT roll to avoid
side effects fails, the patient will be -1 HT for the length of
the treatment plus 1d months afterward (-1 DX, -1 IQ, and
-2 HT on a critical failure); otherwise, these effects persist
for only four to eight hours after injection, or not at all on
a critical success. The second HT roll should be made at the
mid-point of the treatment to determine if the patient is
responding (after a minimum of two months). A successful
roll can justify “buying off” disadvantages associated with
the condition being treated; examples include Chronic
Pain, Social Disease, Susceptible, Terminally Ill,
Unhealing, and Unfit or Very Unfit. Patients should also be

Sensa-Skin Grafts (TL11)
  Sensa-skin is artificial, vat-grown living tissue with an
affinity for living flesh. Sensa-skin placed in extended con-
tact with flesh will actually grow into it over time. Sensa-
skin makes biomod transplants simpler and safer, due to its
unique ability to bond with living flesh.
  The effects of Altered Appearance (p. 169), Altered Bulk
(only to gain in bulk; p. 170), Extreme Sexual Dimorphism
(p. 170), Sex Change (Gender Reassignment or Superficial;
p.    170), Skin Transformation Virus (p.    172), and
Xenosculpting (p. 172) can all be produced through sensa-
skin at TL11+. Treat these as normal surgical or transplant
procedures, except that there is no “surgery” as such – the
sensa-skin is simply carefully attached. There is no need to
wait to grow transplants, no chance of rejection and no
recovery time. The application time for a pre-designed
sensa-skin graft is one hour for every week that a normal
transplant or surgery would require to recover from. All
sensa-skin grafts can be removed without surgery up to HT
¥ 3 hours after the operation takes place, using the same
procedure; after that they are permanently attached and
would require surgery to remove.

    Webguns are personal sidearms available to any adult citizen on most of the fleet ships. They are biogenetic gadgets
 using a blend of genes from several species, as well as custom-designed sequences. Glands produce copious quantities
 of sticky proteins based on spider silk, which can be fired with an explosive puff of air from an internal lung. When fully
 charged, a webgun has enough of this protein for four shots. It cannot be reloaded – instead it produces new shots at
 the rate of one per hour.
    A hit from a webgun works just like Binding 18 (p. B40).

    V  ARIANTS
       As presented, the Naga campaign is based shortly after
    the arrival of the fleet in the Draconis system, and deals
    with the themes of settling in and conflict between various
    groups who want to go about that in different ways. There
    are plenty of opportunities for setting a campaign in alter-
    nate parts of the colonization timeline, or with a different
    set of conditions.

 “Who needs chrome, pal? Meat is where it’s at. Mother
Nature always did it best – she just needed a little help.
Get down to the black clinic, old-timer, and you can be
15 again. If you still want to be human at all.”
 It’s the technology of the posthuman age:
biotech! Upgrade your old body with
steroids, smart drugs, transplants, and viral
nano . . . or get a new one. Improve on
nature with eugenics and gene-fixing. Or go
parahuman – if you love cats, become one!
You have time to explore the possibilities –
death is only a temporary inconvenience
with cryonics and immortality drugs. And
who needs silicon? Vatbrain biocomputers are where 
it’s really at!
 But biotech isn’t just the future. GURPS Bio-Techincludes a full
range of medical equipment from the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries,
from early vaccines to surgical robots, along with game stats for the
world’s deadliest diseases.
 GURPS Bio-Tech also includes character templates for biotech
professions, rules for biotech magic, and two original mini-settings: an alternate
Earth ruled by a clone of Alexander the Great, and a living starship on its way to 
colonize an alien world!
 Say goodbye to your old body. Have you upgraded your genes this year?

 GURPS Bio-Techrequires the GURPS Basic Set, Fourth Edition. You can use the 
campaign settings and information on technology in any game.
