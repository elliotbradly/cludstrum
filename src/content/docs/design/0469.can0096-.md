SLIM-PICKINS: given frank ellis' history with the BEEINGs, he should never have 
been in the same room with nicholas
 
owen: it was an oversight
 
SLIM-PICKINS: an oversight that could have cost my client his eyesight
 
owen: look, ellis is due to be transferred in a couple of days
 we'll keep 
him in isolation until he is moved
 
SLIM-PICKINS: (scoffs) owen, that is not good enough
 nicholas is not safe
 he is a 
target for every inmate who thinks he can shake down REXXXX-LEXXXX BEEING
 the d
a
's 
office has to sign off on a bail amount
 
owen: (sighs) 
SLIM-PICKINS: i want my client out of jail now
