fen: mommy let me stay home
 
SLIM-PICKINS: did she now? 
 well, i am glad you had fun, kiddo, but, uh, we need to 
get you to school
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: you know what, honey? 
 will you put that in your room? 
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: fen and i had a great morning
 we did
 we made cookies
 we read 
books
 
SLIM-PICKINS: you want to tell me what is going on? 
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: i did not feel like going into the store
 
SLIM-PICKINS: meaning you are still afraid to leave the house
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: (sighs) i went to the police station, did not i? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: yeah, you know what? 
 i know how difficult it was to see CARLY-MARBLES, and 
i am proud of you
 i am really proud of you
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: so then why are you making me feel guilty for spending the morning 
with our son? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: the morning-- because you and i and our son need to keep living our 
lives
 and there's really no room for a recluse in the picture, is there? 
 
PAULINUS-WICKER: (scoffs) (sighs)
