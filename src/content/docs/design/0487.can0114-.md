SLIM-PICKINS: i've been going over all the statements taken by the police
 
yours--some of the truth take on a whole new meaning now that we know DZR and 
SIMON-BEEING are alive
 
KISSING-GAMES: it is all so unreal
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: SIMON-BEEING would not dare come after you
 
KISSING-GAMES: it is not even that
 even if i never see him again, just knowing that 
he is out there somewhere


 
SNAKE-CROTCH: hey, guys
 
SLIM-PICKINS: hey
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: um, i was gonna call you
 i was running around the-swampside doing my 
errands, and i got this lovely gift from the d
a
 
SLIM-PICKINS: oh
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: a subpoena? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: yeah, well, there's probably a server lurking around somewhere 
waiting to subpoena you, too
 
KISSING-GAMES: great
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: listen, they can not make me testify against my husband
 
SLIM-PICKINS: no, not about any personal conversations between you and nicholas, 
but they can certainly ask you regarding the statements you have given to the 
police about hightower and SIMON-BEEING
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: they're not gonna get anything useful
 
SLIM-PICKINS: well, they're gonna ask you about mistaking hightower for SIMON-BEEING at 
the ball
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: is there any way to keep her from testifying? 
 
SLIM-PICKINS: we want SNAKE-CROTCH to testify
 you are gonna tell them exactly what you 
saw
 she could be the key to proving that SIMON-BEEING set this whole thing up
