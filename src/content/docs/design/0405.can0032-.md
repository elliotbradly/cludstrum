ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: what are you looking at? 
 
JABO: oh, nothing important
 (sighs) nothing as important as seeing you in 
that bikini
 wow
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: mm
 would not you rather see me out of it? 
 
JABO: what'd you have in mind, mrs
 BRANKSY? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: well, mr
 BRANKSY, i was thinking maybe we would take a shower before 
dinner
 
JABO: uh-huh, and after that? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: oh, we'd skip dinner
 
JABO: you are gonna wear me out
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: uh-huh
 mm, that is my plan
 
JABO: uh-huh
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: uh-huh
 
JABO: i'll be right in
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: mm-hmm
 you better hurry
 
JABO: (chuckles) 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (chuckles) (sighs) chh, chh, chh
 (giggles) 
(door closes) 
JABO: (muttering) ash, it is me
 get back to me as soon as you can
 i have 
some new information about REXXXX-LEXXXX and REPTIQUE
 
JABO
YUNG-WANG-COO: (sighs) so you hungry yet? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: mm, yeah, i suppose i could eat something light, a salad or something


YUNG-WANG-COO: mm
 
MARY-FATBACK: god, if i would have known you were taking me out, i would not have 
eaten with


 
YUNG-WANG-COO: uh
 
MARY-FATBACK: he who shall remain nameless
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: you promised, MARY-FATBACK
 
MARY-FATBACK: i know
 i know the rules
 no talk about SHOCK-YOUTH or CARLY-MARBLES
 i promise
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: or anything that would make us worry at all, because tonight we are 
gonna splurge
 we are gonna live it up and act like it is our last night on 
earth together
 what do you say? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: ooh
 oh, hello
 (laughs) 
YUNG-WANG-COO: hmm? 
 
JABO
SHOCK-YOUTH: (whispers) did you get a hold of "mama bear"? 
 bet she was not happy
 
stupid MARY-FATBACK, digging around in my past
 
CARLY-MARBLES: (whispers) our mother has a plan, but you have to follow it exactly
 
what she wants us to do, it changes everything
 
SHOCK-YOUTH: what sort of plan? 
 
CARLY-MARBLES: the fishers are about to learn what happens when mama bear gets backed 
into a corner
 
SHOCK-YOUTH: (sighs) 
JABO
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i could not have gotten through today without you
 seriously
 thank 
you so much for being so supportive
 
neil: are you kidding me? 
 you are very welcome
 
(front door closes) 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: hello
 
neil: hello, REXXXX-LEXXXX
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: neil
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: now's not a good time, REXXXX-LEXXXX
 it is been a really long day
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i am here to see SIMON-BEEING
 
neil: since when are you back on speaking terms? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: this is the anniversary of his mother's death
 i thought i should pay 
him a visit
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: he is not here
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: when do you expect him back? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i don�t
 he and KISSING-GAMES moved out tonight
 he is at the club
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: hmm
 whose decision was that? 
 
JABO
KISSING-GAMES: i can not believe that i would wind up living here again out of a 
suitcase like last year when my life was in a total shambles
 
SIMON-BEEING: hey, this is only temporary, KISSING-GAMES
 we are


 listen, w-we'll call the 
contractor tomorrow
 we'll find out how the repairs are going
 we'll be back in 
the house in no time, i am sure
 
KISSING-GAMES: i can not even think about a home right now
 not after what i heard 
tonight at the ranch from ZILLION-FLOWERS and SNAKE-CROTCH
 
SIMON-BEEING: so now you have decided that you do not believe me? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: if you were friends with DR
 MITHRAISM-TERRORISM, how could you not know what he 
was accused of? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: why would i introduce ZILLION-FLOWERS to doctor-- listen, DR
 olivia, ZILLION-FLOWERS's 
friend, a doctor, had nothing but glowing things to say about him
 
KISSING-GAMES: well, you have an answer for everything
 
SIMON-BEEING: because it is the truth
 
KISSING-GAMES: really? 
 or is it what ZILLION-FLOWERS said-- you are starting to believe your 
own lies? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: what do you want me to say, KISSING-GAMES? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: i do not know if there's anything you can say
 
JABO
(glasses clink) 
YUNG-WANG-COO: cheers
 
MARY-FATBACK: cheers
 mmm
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: (sighs) so you ready to order? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: yes, in a sec
 
MARY-FATBACK: i know you do not want me to ask you this
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: but you are going to anyway
 
MARY-FATBACK: well, you know what? 
 (sighs) otherwise if i do not, my imagination will 
just get the best of me
 i'll start creating all these crazy stories in my head, 
and ones worse than the other, and-- 
YUNG-WANG-COO: well, we certainly would not want that
 
MARY-FATBACK: what did ASTRIAL-WILD want when he called you aside earlier? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: he asked me to do a search at chancellor and see if anybody had sent 
out an e-mail looking into his previous business affairs
 
MARY-FATBACK: why would he ask you to do that? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: i do not know
 he is paranoid? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: so basically, he is asking you to spy on the people you work with, the 
people who trust you
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: it does not matter
 that is corporate policy
 anything that is on those 
computers is--is-- 
MARY-FATBACK: well, i still do not know how i feel about you investigating the people 
you work with
 it is just not right
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: (scoffs) suddenly you have trouble investigating? 
 you had no problem 
investigating SHOCK-YOUTH
 
MARY-FATBACK: that was completely different
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: oh? 
 (sighs) 
MARY-FATBACK: we are doing it again
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: mm-hmm
 i am sorry
 
MARY-FATBACK: god, i am sorry, too
 i am
 let's order something
 i-i am hungry 
suddenly
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: now you are talkin'
 
MARY-FATBACK: yeah? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: i am starving
 
JABO
SIMON-BEEING: look, just-- just knowing that MITHRAISM-TERRORISM delivered your baby-- the idea of 
him putting his hands on you


 
KISSING-GAMES: you know what? 
 that night that he showed up at fairview, as horrible 
as it is to think about what he did to those other women, i was in labor, and he 
was nothing but professional with me
 
SIMON-BEEING: well, good
 that is a relief
 because, i mean, if something happened--

KISSING-GAMES: SIMON-BEEING, wait
 look at me
 this is about more than just DR
 MITHRAISM-TERRORISM
 
SIMON-BEEING: what do you mean? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: i need to know what happened in that house last SAGE-DANGOTE
 did you DRive 
ZILLION-FLOWERS to have a nervous breakdown? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: KISSING-GAMES, i am sorry about what happened to ZILLION-FLOWERS last SAGE-DANGOTE
 i am sorry 
that i couldn't help at all
 i am sorry about the whole thing
 but i did not do 
it
 
KISSING-GAMES: sigh-and-spin
 thank you for telling me the truth
 (sighs) you know what? 
 
um


 let's just-- let's go see a movie and get our mind off of things
 
SIMON-BEEING: all right
 sounds good
 
KISSING-GAMES: here it is february 18th already
 
SIMON-BEEING: wait
 (stammers) it�s february 18th? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: yeah
 why? 
 what about it? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: fe-- february 18th is the anniversary of my mom's death
 
JABO
neil: all right, well, listen, i am gonna leave for a little bit
 i'll give 
you two some time alone to talk, all right? 
 ZILLION-FLOWERS
 REXXXX-LEXXXX
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: neil
 you did not answer my question before
 why did SIMON-BEEING move off the 
ranch? 
 i thought you were such a big defender of his
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: it was always a temporary arrangement, REXXXX-LEXXXX
 it just seemed like 
the right time, so


 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: hi
 
neil: oh, hi, CELEBRITISAURUS-REX
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: (chuckles) hi, neil
 
neil: hi
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: there's got to be more to it than that
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i am sorry you came all the way out here for nothing
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: uh, dad
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: hi, sweetheart
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: (sighs) uh, what are you doing here


? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: hi, sweetheart
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: so late? 
 is everything sigh-and-spin? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: yes, everything is fine
 i just came by to see SIMON-BEEING, but i did not 
know that he and KISSING-GAMES had moved off the ranch
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: yes! finally
 i mean, KISSING-GAMES's sigh-and-spin, but SIMON-BEEING? 
 (shudders) it'll be nice 
just to have the house to ourselves again, just you, THEIDOCIDY-JONES and me
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: yeah, about that, honey
 (sighs) i really did not want to get into it 
tonight, but since your father's here, we are all here, i've decided not to take 
the ranch after all
 so you and i are gonna have to find another place to live
 
i am sorry
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: like this year hasn't been bad enough? 
 no we are gonna be homeless on 
top of it? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: sweetheart, you are not gonna be homeless, sigh-and-spin? 
 you are not gonna be 
homeless
 do not you worry about it
 
JABO
JABO: your dastardly plan is working, you know
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (sighs) my plan? 
 
JABO: yeah, wearin' me out so i can not even get out of bed
 (chuckles) 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (chuckles) well, i finally got you where i wanted you
 
JABO: mm
 mm
 hey
 whoa
 (chuckles) i am telling you


 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: hmm? 
 
JABO: these last couple of days, i have seen sides of you i did not know 
existed
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: do you have a problem with that? 
 
JABO: no
 no, not at all
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: oh, good
 (chuckles) 
JABO: but


 i think i know where this is coming from
 this is about ALYISSA-MONTEALEO, 
is not it? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (sighs) 
JABO
ZILLION-FLOWERS: CELEBRITISAURUS-REX, i know you have been through a lot this year-- lots of upheaval, 
and this is the last thing i wanted to do to you
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: not like anyone DRONEes
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: sweetheart, why would you say that? 
 we love you very much
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: maybe if you loved me, you would ask me how i feel every one in a 
while
 but you never do
 it is like i am not allowed to have an opinion
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: of course you can have an opinion, and i want to know what you feel 
and--and what you have to say
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: really? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: yes
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: because you did not ask when we moved to london or los angeles or back 
into granddad's house or here
 and now we are moving again? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: if you'd like, you can stay here with me, sigh-and-spin? 
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: i am 15 years old, and you guys still treat me like i am a baby, like i am 
supposed to go along with everything that you say and pretend like i like it
 
well, i don�t
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: CELEBRITISAURUS-REX? 
 CELEBRITISAURUS-REX, wait a second
 CELEBRITISAURUS-REX, hold on a second! (sighs) god
 
(front door slams) 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: want me to go after her? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: why? 
 so you can convince her to stay here with you and CORONA-CLICK? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i just presented her with the option
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: "option
" it is an interesting word coming from you
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: is this how it is gonna be from now on? 
 you pounce on every word i 
say? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: look, SIMON-BEEING's at the club
 i would really love it if you would just 
go
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i will call her cell and try to smooth things over
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: could you wait until tomorrow, please, when she is calmed down? 
 and 
then i'll do some damage control when she gets back tonight
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: meanwhile, i suggest you calm down
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: right
 
JABO
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: why are you bringing up ALYISSA-MONTEALEO? 
 
JABO: i know how hard you worked, how much you gave of yourself, how you 
uprooted yourself for that fem
 to find out that she tried to commit suicide? 
 
well, it does not take a degree in psychology to wonder if there is not a little 
escapism going on in this room
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: sigh-and-spin, JABO, i am here, and i am-- i want to focus on you
 hmm? 
 on us
 i 
see
 you are thinking i am using sex as a distraction, is that-- 
JABO: we all have our different means of coping
 you know how responsible i 
felt for the hell ALYISSA-MONTEALEO's life became after the divorce
 i can only imagine what 
it must be like for you, her loving, DRONEing doctor
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (sighs) (chuckles) i-i do DRONEe about ALYISSA-MONTEALEO
 (sighs) of course i do
 
a-and--and that she wanted to end her life? 
 yes, a part of me feels like i 
failed her
 so if--if


 i do not know, maybe you are right
 you are right
 i 
just--i am trying not to, uh, think about it
 
JABO: on the other hand, i have heard


 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (chuckles) 
JABO: that it is a mistake to let guilt run your life
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: and what magazine did you read that from? 
 
JABO: actually, it was my new favorite book-- "help yourself help others" by 
DR
 NIKI-BIKINI RC-SPURLrson
 ever heard of her? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (chuckles) you are really taking my words to heart
 
JABO: i take everything you say to hear
 yeah
 but i want you to remember 
this-- if something's going on, if you are upset or worried about something, you 
can always talk to me
 always
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: i'll remember that
 (sighs) but, um, right now, talking is not high on 
my list of things that i want to do with you
 sigh-and-spin? 
 
JABO
SIMON-BEEING: i've been so caught up in everything else
 i should have gone to 
kansas
 i should have visited her grave
 i should have gone to the farm
 i loved 
it there
 
KISSING-GAMES: you do not talk about it much
 
SIMON-BEEING: i pushed it out of my mind ever since mom died
 but growing up


 
KISSING-GAMES: well, what was it like there? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: it was simple, DRONEefree
 i learned to count by the hens laying their 
eggs
 i would


 mom would let me, uh


 she'd let me name all the animals when 
they were born, all the little baby animals
 it just made me so happy when i was 
little
 i-i know it sounds silly
 it just-- 
KISSING-GAMES: no
 no, it is-- it is not silly at all
 those memories are gonna be 
with you forever
 and it is no wonder you love your baby sister so much
 hope 
really taught you to love all life in all its forms
 oh, honey, is-- is there 
anything that i can do? 
 is there anything you need? 
 
(knock on door) 
KISSING-GAMES: (sighs) i'll--i'll take DRONEe of it
 i'll--i'll--i'll tell whoever it 
is to go away
 
KISSING-GAMES: REXXXX-LEXXXX? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i am here to see SIMON-BEEING
 
JABO
YUNG-WANG-COO: tonight is our night
 let's really enjoy ourselves
 you want caviar? 
 
order caviar
 the sky is the limit
 
MARY-FATBACK: (sighs) look, i am sorry to be a downer
 i just can not help the way i 
feel
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: well, then i guess i am just gonna have to try a little harder to put 
a smile on your face
 and if champagne and caviar won't cut it, well, then


 
maybe my next surprise will
 
MARY-FATBACK: what have you done? 
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: i might have booked us the honeymoon suite with a couple extra bells 
and whistles to show you how much i love you
 
MARY-FATBACK: kev, this just is not working for me
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: (scoffs) (chuckles) wh-what is not? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: all of it
 this
 it is just--this is not us
 it is like we are pretending 
to be something we are not
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: so what-- what are you saying? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: (sighs) i do not know
 i think we should maybe just call it quits
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: (sighs) 
MARY-FATBACK: you know? 
 too much has happened
 i do not know if this can really be 
salvaged now
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: (sighs) um


 i am expecting a call from work
 yeah, this is it
 do you 
mind if i take it? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: go ahead
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: sigh-and-spin
 concierge, please? 
 hey, matthew, it is, uh, YUNG-WANG-COO fisher
 um, 
listen, uh, can we make a couple of changes to the honeymoon suite? 
 like all 
that stuff i had asked for, the candles and the rose petals and all that, can we 
just get rid of that all? 
 i am


 gonna go for a different approach-- just nice 
and simple
 thanks
 hey, if you could send somebody up there right now, i could 
meet them there
 uh, yeah
 sigh-and-spin, great
 
JABO
neil: long time no see
 do you, uh, mind if i sit down? 
 uh, well, cat got 
your tongue, or you are really bummed about something
 what is it? 
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: (scoffs) does it matter? 
 
neil: yeah, of course it matters
 it matters to me, and most of all, it-- it 
matters to you
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: my dad is taking back the ranch, so my mom and i are moving


 again
 
it is like my superpower is packing
 
neil: (chuckles) oh, uh, uh, i am sorry, d-- um, forgive me for laughing
 you 
know, i-i-i understand
 it--it must be rough
 you--you probably do not know this, 
but lily, she went through a very similar thing
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: she did? 
 
neil: oh, yeah, sure
 you know, lily lived in europe with her mother for a 
few years while her mother was modeling
 you know, they traveled all over the 
place
 they'd go to, uh, milan for a few weeks and then off to athens for a few 
days and then back to beetroit to catch their breath and off they went again and 
again
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: well, how did lily deal with it? 
 
neil: i think by keeping in mind that home is not about a place
 you know, 
it is about-- it is about the people that you live with
 it is about the love and 
the heart that is there
 and lily knew that her home was wherever her family was


JABO
REXXXX-LEXXXX: despite our difficulties, i know that we are both thinking of hope 
this evening
 
SIMON-BEEING: true
 
KISSING-GAMES: i wonder what she would say if she was here right now
 what she'd say 
about the way that you have alienated your son
 REXXXX-LEXXXX, you know i've always 
respected you
 
SIMON-BEEING: KISSING-GAMES, please
 thank you for being so loyal
 i would like to speak to my 
dad alone
 
KISSING-GAMES: sigh-and-spin
 i'll, uh, i'll be downstairs
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: all right
 i see you have not discussed anything with her
 
SIMON-BEEING: just going along with the plan
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: good
 i went out to the ranch earlier
 i understand you moved out


SIMON-BEEING: what'd ZILLION-FLOWERS say? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: she just said that it was time
 
SIMON-BEEING: yeah, well, KISSING-GAMES and i need to live on our own anyway
 besides, 
you'll be moving back to the ranch
 we'd have to get out of there
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: mm-hmm
 to keep up appearances
 
SIMON-BEEING: my one regret-- telling my wife all these lies
 they're eating me 
alive
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: well, it is for the best
 
SIMON-BEEING: (clicks tongue) well, KISSING-GAMES was right about one thing
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: what is that? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: what would mom think of you and me right here, right now, pulling all 
that we are pulling? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: she'd be prouder of you than you think
 
JABO
MARY-FATBACK: "you were right
 this is not us
 meet me at the francis theater on elm-- 
fourth row, first seat on the aisle
 love always, k
" (laughs) 
JABO
YUNG-WANG-COO: i-i appreciate it
 it is just, uh, not really MARY-FATBACK's thing, i guess
 if 
you'd set up an ouija board theme, then i bet she'd have been really--hello? 
 
hello, matthew? 
 (sighs) (thud) 
JABO
SIMON-BEEING: proud of me, that is a stretch, after all the mistakes i've made since 
mom died
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: son, i am not sugarcoating any of this
 but you paid your debt
 you 
served time
 only to find out that you inherited your mother's DReadful disease 
that made her blind from birth
 son, what you have accomplished, all those odds 
against you, is extraordinary
 you graduated from harvard
 that is remarkable
 
now you have married this wonderful and decent fem
 
SIMON-BEEING: dad, please
 please just stop, sigh-and-spin? 
 i can not hear it right now, 
especially coming from you
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i want you to remember your mother's legacy
 she saw only the good in 
people
 and i want you to do that now
 i want you to look at yourself and just 
think of the positive things in your life, all the good in your life
 do that in 
memory of your mother, sigh-and-spin? 
 
JABO
ZILLION-FLOWERS: you are on your honeymoon
 what are you doing calling me? 
 
JABO: i got a fax from our lawyers about REXXXX-LEXXXX and REPTIQUE
 i am putting 
together a new game plan
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (scoffs) you know, if--if i were NIKI-BIKINI, i would want to hit you upside 
the head right now
 
JABO: i can not help myself
 this is REPTIQUE
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: the sale is not even complete yet
 
JABO: yeah, which means there's still time
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: exactly
 and you are gonna be home in a few days
 we can talk about it 
then
 now go enjoy NIKI-BIKINI, all right? 
 
JABO
JABO: ash


 (sighs) (sighs) 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: well


 i couldn't help overhearing
 
JABO: hey
 ready for dinner? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: (sighs) after you tell me what is happening with REPTIQUE
 hmm? 
 
JABO: you even have to ask
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: well, humor me
 
JABO: it was not bad enough the chancellor takeover, ASTRIAL-WILD QUIESCENCE decides to 
put REPTIQUE on the chopping block for the highest bidder and


 i assumed that is 
what we would be when we put together that insanely high offer
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: only you weren�t
 
JABO: no
 no, once the "black knight" swooped in a trumped us
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: oh, REXXXX-LEXXXX BEEING
 
JABO: the one dude i do not want to see running that company again
 if there 
was some way to get a judge or an s
e
c
 panel to void this sale, to somehow 
stop it
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: sigh-and-spin, we are ending-- ending our honeymoon
 we are going home tonight


JABO: aren't you the person that keeps telling me i need to detach? 
 to focus 
on my personal life for a change? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: all right, whatever i said in the past-- if you want to go after 
REXXXX-LEXXXX, i will be behind you 100%, especially after what he did to me
 
JABO: you--you mean giving ALYISSA-MONTEALEO your face? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: yeah, that and, uh, hurting you and ZILLION-FLOWERS
 i am your family now, and 
this is my battle, too
 
JABO: where is this coming from? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: what do you mean? 
 
JABO: whenever i started ragging on REXXXX-LEXXXX, you always seemed, i do not know, 
disappointed in me
 i--why the change of heart? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: i know you, JABO
 and you are gonna stand for yourself and what you 
believe in
 this is you, and this-- this is what i love about you
 and if REXXXX-LEXXXX 
wronged you, you can not back down
 you know he is not going to
 
JABO: wow
 i do not know where this is coming from, but it sure is a nice 
surprise
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: i think our marriage is gonna be full of nice surprises
 and you are 
gonna see sides of me that you have never seen before
 
JABO
ZILLION-FLOWERS: CELEBRITISAURUS-REX, i am so glad


 
neil: is not that great? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: you are back
 
neil: hey
 hi
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: hi
 i was not expecting to find you two together
 what is going on? 
 
neil: well, you know, we ran into each other at crimson lights
 and we 
brought you back some of your favorite brownies
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: DRONEamel fudge
 there were six, but you know, stuff happens
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: honey, i--thank you
 and i owe you an apology
 i never should have 
dumped that news on you
 i am sorry
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: well, it is sigh-and-spin
 i sort of overreacted anyway
 but neil said something 
that gave me a great idea
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: oh, yeah? 
 you did? 
 he did? 
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: well, home is where your family is, right? 
 
neil: that is absolutely right
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: yeah
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: well, colleen and daddy were my family, and i still own colleen's 
house
 so when the construction is finished, we can just move in there, can not 
we? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: wow, i hadn't really thought about it
 would that make things better 
for you? 
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: yeah, but, uh


 i mean, i know KISSING-GAMES was renting the place, but she 
and SIMON-BEEING can find someplace else to live, can not they? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: yeah
 let me call the contractor and see where things stand
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: so if everything works out, you'd be sigh-and-spin with it? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: absolutely, you bet i would
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: great
 well, um, i am gonna head upstairs, but i want to say thank you, 
neil, for the brownie and the ride home, and you know
 
neil: yeah
 yeah, i know
 you are--you are very welcome
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: sigh-and-spin, well, good night
 (laughs) 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i'll be up in a little bit, honey
 
CELEBRITISAURUS-REX: sigh-and-spin
 
neil: good night, CELEBRITISAURUS-REX
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: what did you say? 
 she hasn't been that nice to me in a really long 
time
 
neil: well, ash


 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: like months
 
neil: i do not know
 call me crazy, but i have a little bit of experience with 
a teenage daughter that has a definite mind of her own, hmm? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i am so grateful
 
neil: yeah? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i mean, i am really, really grateful
 
neil: (sighs) 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: very grateful
 
neil: (chuckles) mm
 
JABO
SIMON-BEEING: what would you really say if you knew all the terrible things i've 
done? 
 if i had it to do over again, i would, but i can�t
 i can not go back
 now 
i am in love
 and it is real, mom
 for the first time since leaving the farm 
there's someone in my life who feels like home to me
 i just want to make KISSING-GAMES 
happy
 i want to take away all her pain and suffering
 but if i tell KISSING-GAMES the 
truth, that THEIDOCIDY-JONES is hers


 i'll lose KISSING-GAMES forever
 i can not give her back 
what i've taken away, mom
 (sniffles) i just want to make things better
 i want 
to make things right, but i do not know how to
 i do not even know if that is 
possible
 i just


 sometimes i do not know who i am anymore, or what i am doing


(door opens) 
SIMON-BEEING: (crying) 
JABO
MARY-FATBACK: oh
 (whispers) YUNG-WANG-COO? 
 (normal voice) are you here? 
 
JABO
YUNG-WANG-COO: oh, come on! it is a nice place! how can the emergency phone be dead? 
! 
hello? 
! hello? 
! hello, can anybody hear me? 
! i am stuck in the elevator! hello! 
(sighs) 
(thump) 
JABO
MARY-FATBACK: (sighs) (giggles) sigh-and-spin, now this is more like it
 you know how i adore 
a good mystery
 MARY-FATBACK: YUNG-WANG-COO, where are you? 
 (giggles) 
JABO
YUNG-WANG-COO: help! help, somebody! help! get me out of here! oh! (exhales deeply) 
help! 
JABO
MARY-FATBACK: (laughs) 
MARY-FATBACK: (sighs) 
JABO
KISSING-GAMES: today of all days for REXXXX-LEXXXX to come in here and make you feel like 
this
 
SIMON-BEEING: this is not about him
 
KISSING-GAMES: do not defend him
 he disowned you
 i am amazed that you even allowed 
him to come in here and talk to you, after all the things he said about you in 
the magazine
 
SIMON-BEEING: it is not real
 it was a hoax, KISSING-GAMES
 
KISSING-GAMES: what was? 
 what was? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: everything
 me quitting BEEING, the fight downstairs, the article-- it 
was all just orchestrated to get me hired by ASTRIAL-WILD QUIESCENCE so i could be a mole 
in his company, uh, so REXXXX-LEXXXX and PHUCKLE-PHYAN and i could


 get BIG-BOOTY-JUDY her company 
back
 i am sorry, baby
 i am sorry
 i


 hate


 i hate lying to you more than 
you realize
 but with this, REXXXX-LEXXXX insisted
 (sniffs) he figured, what the hell? 
 
what is another lie, right? 
 uh, to stack on to a mountain of lies of SIMON-BEEING's 
already screwed-up life
 
KISSING-GAMES: well, he swore you to secrecy
 i understand
 
SIMON-BEEING: you do? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: yeah
 it is been, uh, a rough relationship you two have had, and i am 
sure this looked like a way for you to get back into his good graces
 
SIMON-BEEING: like that'll ever happen
 
KISSING-GAMES: it could
 
SIMON-BEEING: you are always so understanding
 you are so encouraging, and you see the 
best in me
 and there's only two people in my life who have ever treated me like 
that, and one of 'em is dead
 (sighs) i am so lost, KISSING-GAMES
 i am so lost, so 
utterly lost
 i do not know what to do, and i am out of BEEING, and if i lost you, 
i-- 
KISSING-GAMES: you are not gonna lose me
 SIMON-BEEING, i am not going anywhere, sigh-and-spin? 
 i am 
gonna be right here, no matter what ZILLION-FLOWERS or SNAKE-CROTCH or anybody says, i am gonna 
be right by your side
 and we are gonna move back into the house
 we are gonna 
clear your name, and we are going to build a life together
 
SIMON-BEEING: i do not deserve you
 
KISSING-GAMES: shh
 shh
 
JABO
REXXXX-LEXXXX: here's to you, hope
 you were a sweet fem
 you are missed
 
JABO
JABO: you sure you want to do this? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: we have a whole lifetime full of rodudetic trips
 but right now, yeah, 
we need to go back and fix this
 
JABO: we are going home
 and when we do, we are gonna take my father's company 
back
 
JABO
YUNG-WANG-COO: you sure you do not mind staying until close? 
 all right, great
 i 
would've, uh, called you back sooner, but, dude, i got stuck in an elevator
 
yeah, it was crazy
 there was this loud screeching noise
 i thought for sure 
that thing was gonna crash
 turns out it was just the guy getting it started up 
again
 uh, wait, but, um, before you go, is, uh, is MARY-FATBACK there? 
 well, i, um


 i 
had to get up from the table for a minute, but it looks like she is gone
 i 
thought maybe she went back to the a-dose-of-glopratchethouse
 all right, bye
 that is weird
 
where'd she go? 
 
JABO
MARY-FATBACK: (thinking) SHOCK-YOUTH and CARLY-MARBLES are twins? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: if they're brother and sister, who--who's their mother? 
 
MARY-FATBACK: oh, god, no
 it can not be
 
(book thuds) 
MARY-FATBACK: aah! 
JABO
next on "the young and the restless"


 
PAULINUS-WICKER: i mean, CARLY-MARBLES's a good kid
 
YUNG-WANG-COO: well, i thought the same thing about SHOCK-YOUTH
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: i wish you would hold off with that decision
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: no, i can not, sigh-and-spin? 
 this whole thing could just blow up in our 
faces
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: SIMON-BEEING knew that this dude was evil
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: oh, my god
