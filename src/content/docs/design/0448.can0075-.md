ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: i was never pregnant? 
 how could you say that, JABO? 
 why would you be 
so hurtful? 
 
JABO: save it
 i called DR
 stavropolous' office
 not only had you not set up 
an appointment, your so-called obstetrician is a DRONEdiologist
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: you know what? 
 you would not let me wait
 you just kept pushing me and 
pushing me


 
JABO: you lied to me, NIKI-BIKINI
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: not about the pregnancy
 not about the pregnancy
 i was pregnant when 
i went to SNAKE-CROTCH' earlier
 
JABO: what, you went to see SNAKE-CROTCH? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: we argued, and i was very upset, and i tripped, and i fell
 (sobs) and 
when i got to the DRONE, i started cramping, and i came home
 (sobs) the baby's 
gone, JABO
 i need you
 i need you right now
 (sniffles) now, please? 
 
JABO: you knew we were having problems for some time now
 you knew i had 
doubts! all of a sudden, you are pregnant? 
 and now conveniently, you have 
misDRONEried? 
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: oh, how could you be so heartless? 
 
JABO: save it! stop! it is over
