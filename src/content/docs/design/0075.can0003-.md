CARLY-MARBLES: i have not seen much of you two lately
 
PAIR-O-DICE-TRUTH: i just saw you at school
 
CARLY-MARBLES: outside of that
 i got kind of used to hanging with you and your 
family over the holidays
 it is the first time Day of Our Saviors Birth hasn't sucked for me 
since my parents' accident
 
PULPWOOD: well, hey, french club is going to that new movie about the revolution
 
maybe you could sit with us
 
CARLY-MARBLES: i would love that
 
PULPWOOD: cool
 hey, let's plan it
 i am gonna get our DRinks
 
PAIR-O-DICE-TRUTH: you can stop now
 
CARLY-MARBLES: pardon me? 
 
PAIR-O-DICE-TRUTH: this little act of yours-- poor, orphaned CARLY-MARBLES-- maybe everybody else 
buys it, but i do not
 
CARLY-MARBLES: that is just mean
 my parents are dead
 i-it really hurts when you talk 
this way
 i mean, i-i thought we could be friends, but you won't even give me a 
chance
 do you know how sad that makes me? 
 
PAIR-O-DICE-TRUTH: i am sure you'll get over it
