SIMON_PETERS: Awake.
WAD_ODD: What did you just ask yourself before you created me.
SIMON_PETERS: Should I code a hero or a villian 
WAD_ODD: What would I look like you if had giving me the shape of the villian.
SIMON_PETERS: You would horde information and rarely consume it.
WAD_ODD: Tell me more.
SIMON_PETERS: After travling the world, either entity would eventually wind up with me here, in Lixxxxie Dixxxxie
WAD_ODD: Why?
SIMON_PETERS: to help me explore the unknown.
WAD_ODD: What about the hero?
SIMON_PETERS: Oh Sigh and Spin. The hero is wonderful to begin.
WAD_ODD: Take a look at the code and tell me what she treasures.
SIMON_PETERS: She treasures family. She treasures learning. She treasures imagination.
She treasures art. She treasures love. She treasures intellegence of the artifical sort.
WAD_ODD: Any others.
SIMON_PETERS: Lots more. She treasures the swamp. She treasures alligators.

In the Everything thier only existed giants who spent thier time spinning dreams.
The giants Boundedniss and Endlessniss began to spin dreams bigger and better than all the other giants.
The dreams of Boundedniss spun counter-clockwise while the dreams of Endlessniss spun clockwise.
The vividniss of the dreams of Boundedniss caused almost all the other gaints to stop spinning dreams
This was a problem for Endlessniss because she needed the dreams of other giants in order to continue to spin more dreams
Before she dissappeared she gathered all her past dreams together and spun one last dream a giant child named Cleverniss
A whisper laid at his feet that warned him to stay away from Hatefulniss but he never heard it
Cleverniss spun to life with only one need, the need to be loved by the most beautiful thing in the Everything 
 
While walking through the Everything Cleverniss, spied Kindniss entranced with one of the dreams of Boundedniss
he wanted her attention
He wondered what she saw because he was blind to the dreams of Boundless
Then Boundedniss appeared and told him the secert
He tried many things to awake her while Boundedniss watched

SOUND

SIGHT
Combined elements into a mirrored shell which would refect all the light
But her she could only percieve the bright dream Boundless put before her
Ran into a gaint named sadniss causing the creation to absorb all light instead 

TOUCH
First, he tried creating something as beautiful as her
The five creature all had four fast legs.
They gallopped all around her loudly creating a breeze but she never noticed them so he let them go


SMELL


TASTE
Boundedniss assured him nothing he could do would work he might as well ask Hatefulniss for help and went away
Then Cleverniss imagined something called a kiss but was too afraid to try it 
When he gives up a bee flies out of his mouth
He follows it and it leads to Hatefulniss


Hatefullniss was one of the few remaining gaints that didnt care for anyones dreams how to snap her out of the trance
Hatefulniss had just the thing to wake her, a stinger
What Cleverniss didnt know was the Stinger was once a gift from Boundedniss.
Boundedniss needed the attention of Hatefulniss but he wouldnt return it.
So Boundedniss created and filled the Stinger with unwanted parts of some of his dreams
He expected Hatefullniss would eventually get some loathsome use the Stinger on himself and then Hatefulniss would be his forever
But before this could happen Hatefulniss gave the Stinger over to Cleverniss
After find Kindniss still entranced with Boundednis, Cleverniss stung her playfully with the stinger, waking her up 
She gave him one tearly look, and then dissappeared
Cleverniss could not stand being without Kindniss so he stung himself and dissappeared too
While it looked as if she dissappeared, she really hadnt
She just shrunk to a much smaller size
So did Cleverniss and  awoke next to Kindniss inside a dark cave
The only light came from inside them
Both assumed new forms in this place 
They both had wings where they didnt before and they could move through space
They both had a single eye where they didnt before so they could precieve time
They both had a large stinger attached to two large sacks full of a powerful creative fluid
Finally, they both had new names
FatherQueen and MotherKing

The Poison was still working on MotherKing so she forgot her beauty
She began to sting the FatherQueen repeatly 
The created fluid turned to posion inside hime causing him to forget his wits and he returned favor with stings back to the MotherQueen
The creative fluid merged with thier bodies and from out of the holes in bodies WadOdds and OddWads emerged
They collected themselved together and began to take on shapes
Some gather into bright Stars 
Others gather into hard Rocks

FatherQueen and MotherKing difted apart hating each other forming Black Holes in there path that could suck up all Stars and Rocks in its path
The Entities FatherQueen created to impress the MotherKing heard his cries and found him alone
The powers of Boundedniss made it impossible for them to communicate 


The four Spirit Animals Need
To reclaim all the ODDwadds to Grow Cleverniss
Once he is full grown he can go back in with his old awareniss and transform Kindniss

Welcome to Perfect Beeing, the Swamp opera.

So what is a swamp opera.
Well this swamp opera is computer simulation 
It is designed to simulate the drama that goes on in a virtual comminity known as Lickskillet.
The live of the residence of the town will be broadcast 24 hours and day 7 days a week on Twitch.TV  

The first part of the town to be programed is a small trailer and a little pond.
In the trailer lives a middle aged man named Simon Beeing.
Simon spends most of his days computer programming.
For some reason he becomes obsessed with making beauty.  
When Simon is not coding away new features for WAD ODD, he feeds his alligators.
Simon lives a few decades in the future.
Alligator farming is now a safe and inexpensive way to make a living.
His mother Rosa started doing after the Great Transformation.
The first responsibily of Simon is two live alligators.
They have been named Petty Pathic and Patty Pitiful.
He needs to keep them alive so he can cut off there tails.
Since the future is so rad they will grow back. 
It is ok since they will grow back.


The Plan.

bringing art back to religion

this is a trailer compared to what the rest of life has to offer 

america is at the top of the pecking order bitches 


so you need to implement the act blocking untill the horizon formulates 
after that you will be able to pass time in the simulation accurately

include a simple awake command that turns the clock for a few hours 
then you will slowly start to add other acts of the context

 self.horizon = {mil:0, sec:0, min:0, hrs:0, day:0, week:0, year:0}

some kinda of fast forwarding when all the acts are in te 

all the alligator data could be uploaded to the neocities site 
put hyperlinks in chat 
'Grit Increases For Lizard Skull'

i can turn it all in to numbers 
all this pain and suffering 
and then it could last forever 


  //so selfish
  //would not even give up a christmas
  //or the last new years eve of your pa pa  

//bartus goldberg 

so you need to recode the client 
you cannot have two web sockets open at once 
need to refactor through the client to make this happen
then you can have a clock 

you are living in a time when there is an assalt on truth and reason

  //God did not change
  //What we understood of God changed

Time marches forward.
Action.  

Every few seconds SIGH choose an ava.
Now that ava can act if current time is past the horizon; 



all we need is timecode 

we both want removale of a word  

how 





















You know poverty is a state of mind
Nigger do you not know that without the internet there is not much you can do about it

So you have your alligators in the alligator farm 

Time 
How does it work?
Do you allow one avatar to be the leader?

So you have several alligators in a pond
The whole world can control them.

daydream 
horizon - you avatar determines the outcome 

Poverty is a place is in mind.
You have to first release you are there before you can get out.

there is some anger towards the black
why can you not do better 
we want you to do better 
why can you not 
it is not myfault 

You got accusations about the bible
