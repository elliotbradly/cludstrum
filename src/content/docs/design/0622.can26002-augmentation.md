 . . . stitches 

                                        and spare parts . . .    

         Two things you learn fast in this business—the quickest way to guarantee you’ll get a call is to 
   light up a butt or grab some stuffers, and the worse the weather, the more calls you’re gonna get. 
         I was eating and Gonzo was having a smoke, so of course we got two calls. Two clients, same 
   place. The AR showed location, best route, ETA, and all the vitals the DocWagon bracelets could grab. 
   Didn’t look good—Lone Star chatter hinted at a firefight at an Aztechnology facility. Dangerous, 
   sure. But that’s why the initials on our jackets said HTR—High Threat Response. 
         We didn’t run sirens—it wouldn’t have done any good—but we made good time despite the 
   heavy rain. The drill was to grab ’em, stuff ’em in the wagon, and get the hell out before things 
   started shooting at us. Treatment came later, since the facilities in the rig were better than the field 
   kits anyway. 
         This one was bad, I could tell right away. It looked like a miniature warzone, with bodies strewn 
   all around—sec guards and shadowrunners. I stepped out near a troll body riddled with bullets, 
   his face blown out, rain spattering his brains. Beyond, a guard missing the left side of his head was 
   draped grotesquely over a parked car. From far off, sirens meant the imminent arrival of either the 
   Star or more corpsec—bad news either way. My commlink homed in on our two clients and I quickly 
   relayed the information to Gonzo’s AR. “Get her!” I barked, pointing at a moaning female ork curled 
   into a fetal position near the outside of the fence, her leg a twitching mass of blood and sparking wire. 
   “Leave the dwarf. Nothing we can do.”
         “What that fuck?” he protested. “He’s right        there!”  He gestured madly at the huddled form of 
   our second client, just on the other side of the fence. Above him, the jaguar-head Aztechnology logo 
   gleamed in the driving rain. 
          “Get your ass over here    now  and help me! You forget your training already? Extraterritoriality. 
   We can’t go in there and you know it!”
         For a split-second Gonzo hesitated, just idealistic enough that he still thought we could buck 
   the system to save a life. We could have saved the guy, too—we both knew it. But extraterritoriality 
   is a harsh master, and anybody who flouts it gets hung out to dry. Way of the world,                 omae  . Hell, 
   even our ork client was going to have to deal with it—the Azzies knew we had her, and they’d be filing 
   extradition papers within an hour.
         “Fuck!” Gonzo yelled in frustration, then pelted over and joined me at the ork’s side. We hustled 
   her onto the stretcher and into the back of the wagon. 
         “Get this thing turned around,” I ordered. “I’ll be there in a minute.” Without waiting for an answer, 
   I glanced toward the approaching sec-team and then hurried over to another body slumped nearby. A 
   few deft cuts and I was done. Hey, he wasn’t a client, he was dead anyway, and you can’t let ’ware like 
   that go to waste—not on what they’re paying us. I ducked low and headed back to the rig at a run.

                                                                                                                                                     

                                                          . . . cybertech . . . 

                                        Sometimes I wonder what I’ve done.
                                        She called again this morning. I didn’t answer. I didn’t know what to say to her. Didn’t know 
                                  what I   could  say.
                                        I’m drunk again. This room stinks like booze and stale cigarette smoke and machine oil. I sit 
                                  on the edge of the bed, my hands spasming through my hair. Even my hair is fake. What kind of 
                                  messed-up shit is that—fake hair? My fingers twitch involuntarily, and I turn down the reaction 
                                  setting with a flick of my mind. I stare unblinkingly at the bottle on the table. That was one of the 
                                  things that freaked her—the fact that I never blinked. I tried to make myself do it at first, but after 
                                  awhile it didn’t seem worth the effort anymore. If she really loved me, she’d have lived with it. The 
                                  bitch should have—
                                        Fuck.
                                        There I go again. 
                                        It’s happening again. It happens too often these days.
                                        I fumble for the bottle and snatch it up. Dammit, I had to do it. I had to keep the edge. You fall 
                                  behind the SOTA in this biz, you die. When you look at it that way, a little loss of humanity makes a 
                                  lot of sense. You want to lose some of it, or all of it? It’s not like I can quit. It’s not like she didn’t know 
                                  she wasn’t going to get the picket fence and the 2.5 kids with me.
                                        Still, I thought we were in it for the long haul. She was my center—the only one I could go to 
                                  when things got too bad and this fucking business started to smother me. She was the one who talked 
                                  me down when my brain wouldn’t stop whirling. She argued hard against me taking this next step, 
                                  didn’t understand why I had to. She tried, but I saw her eyes when she looked at me. People think that 
                                  because I’ve got all this chrome in me, I don’t feel. I’m not some fucking cyberzombie. I’m still human.
                                        More than human. Or maybe less.
                                        Either way, I’d give it all up to go back two days in time. Before that idiot flirted with her in the 
                                  bar. Before I—
                                        My teeth grit. The red haze hits again. The bottle shatters into shards as my hand—my chrome-
                                  and-circuitry, state-of-the-art technological wonder of a hand—clenches around it. Without even 
                                  thinking I adjust my pain receptors to dull the sting, watching idly as blood pools in my palm and 
                                  drips onto the broken glass on the floor. Watching like it’s somebody else’s hand.
                                        Which, up until a couple of weeks ago, it was. How much of me used to belong to somebody else? 
                                  How much of me is even still the guy she used to care about? At least the blood’s still mine—for now.
                                        The comm buzzes again. It’s her. 
                                        I don’t answer.

               cyberWare triggerS
                    Unless	otherwise	stated,	cyberware	that	is	capable	of	being	
               activated	or	deactivated	can	be	done	so	with	a	mental	impulse.	
               This	is	because	the	cyberware	has	been	connected	to	the	user’s	
               nervous	system,	so	it	can	be	used	in	the	same	way	the	user	would	
               move	a	finger	or	flex	a	muscle.	Typically,	when	a	cyberware	device	
               is	installed,	the	user	must	spend	some	time	adjusting	to	this	new	
               ability	and	will	doubtlessly	trigger	the	device	accidentally	a	few	
               times.	Activating	or	deactivating	cyberware	is	a	Free	Action.
                    If	the	gamemaster	allows	it,	methods	of	manually	triggering	a	
               cyberware	device	may	also	be	used,	such	as	a	subdermal	switch.	Such	
               triggers	incur	no	extra	cost.	They	can	be	both	a	drawback	(if	enemies	
               find	out	about	them)	and	an	advantage	(if	friends	know	about	them).
                    Most	cyberware	does	not	require	additional	trigger	controls	
               beyond	those	available	through	direct	neural	interface	or	wireless	
               link.	Some	implants,	however,	come	equipped	with	remote	access	
               or	automatic	triggers.	These	triggers	are	primarily	used	when	the	
               person	has	been	implanted	without	his	knowledge	or	against	his	
               will	(with	a	cranial	bomb,	for	example)	when	the	implant	requires	
               activation	only	in	certain	situations	regardless	of	whether	the	
               person	is	conscious	or	able	to	(an	auto-injector	containing	an	an-
               tidote,	for	example).	Remote	triggers	and	automatic	triggers	also	
               incur	no	extra	cost;	they	must	simply	be	noted	when	purchased.

               remote access
                    Remote	triggers	typically	feature	a	passive,	one-way	wireless	
               link	that	does	not	broadcast	out	until	it	is	triggered	by	receiving	
               a	specific	encrypted	code.	Since	these	wireless	links	remain	silent	
               until	triggered,	they	are	undetectable	until	active,	and	then	they	
               are	treated	as	hidden	nodes	(see	PAN Modes,	p.	211,	SR4         .) 	

               automatic triggers
                    Automatic	triggers	can	be	linked	to	a	normal	or	implanted	            Only	standard	and	alpha-grade	cyberware	is	available	as	
               biomonitor	(see	p.	329,	           ndSR4	a  	p.	39),	which	will	activate/de-second-hand	cyberware.	Beta-	and	deltaware	implants	are	too

               operating	parameters.	Alternately,	the	automatic	trigger	can	be	     the	person	they	were	originally	designed	for.	After	locating	a

                                                                 . . . biotech . . . 

                                        “All right, tusker. Let’s see this stuff of yours,” Kane drawled over his commlink. Seconds later 
                                  a request popped up in AR to connect his commlink with another PAN, followed by another message 
                                  from the doc. 
                                        “Got yourself a shitload of oro from a haul, eh? Selling out old friends again?” Her roaring 
                                  laughter was broken by several grunts. “Here, southern boy. I just patched you into my system. Take 
                                  your time. Buzz me if you see something you like. I have an appointment.”
                                        Kane instantly called up the menu of Butch’s catalogue, discarding the bio-corp pop-up ad-
                                  vertisements to cut down to the novelties. “AR mode or full simsense experience?” his commlink’s 
                                  automated sultry voice asked in the usual Mississippi twang. “The real deal, darlin’,” he subvocal-
                                  ized. 
                                        In a blink he was underwater, swimming through the waves. The gear pulled oxygen out of 
                                  the water and passed it to Kane just like he was out in regular air. To get a feel for the new ’ware he 
                                  stopped the rush and spiraled up to the surface toward the sunlight. He felt the gills open and close, 
                                  and he dipped a curious finger in the gill slits that now sat on his upper chest right above the lungs. 
                                  An arrow popped up, pointing toward his shark skin and the denticles implanted there that gave him 
                                  superior hydrodynamic properties. 
                                        The jade green Shiawase logo rose from the sea floor while a female voice spoke very politely. 
                                                                                                                TM
                                  “Thank you for choosing Shiawase Biotech. The Shiawase Samebito                   package is for divers, marine

                                        Kane had made his decision before the voice shut up. “Nah, this ain’t me. I need something 
                                  worth risking a trip to the butcheress.” He dropped out of the simulation for a second, browsing the 
                                  catalogue in AR mode. 
                                        He stopped at a clip showing a climber using a spider silk implantation. He shook his head in 
                                  amusement. “Bio-gadgeteers read too many comics,” he muttered. 
                                        Suddenly his eye caught the upgrade section promoting bio-addons. “Orthoskin upgrades?” A 
                                  smile stretched across his scarred face as he dived into the next adsim to test the goods. 
                                        A few minutes later he came out and messaged Butch. “Alrighty, Doc. I got a hankering for 
                                  these ortho upgrades. Be sure that you have some dragon hide around—the Most Notorious Man

                                   The first thing she saw was the pale blue gel. It was everywhere. It oozed from her body as they pulled her from 
                             the tank—dripping as if she had just been birthed from an alien womb. The realization made her smile, as it was 
                             not so far from the truth. The smile disintegrated a moment later as she began retching helplessly onto the floor. 
                                   During her immersion, that oxygenated gel had kept her alive. Once out of the tank and conscious again, 
                             her body rejected it, forcing it from her lungs and stomach in wracking spasms. Thick blue liquid spilled across 
                             the clean white floor, even as people in white coats lifted her shivering body from the cold tiles. The attendants 
                             carried her to a warm examination table. As her body expelled the last of the gel, her convulsions slowly stilled. 
                             She felt suddenly exhausted, drawing slow ragged breaths. The drugs still in her system took over. She barely 
                             registered gloved hands briskly wiping her down before she passed out. 
                                   The light was the next thing she saw. She came to suddenly, her eyes refusing to focus. She blinked hard 
                             and faces came swimming into view. 
                                   “Ms. Yoshiko Hino?”
                                   “How long have I been in there?” she mumbled. Her words were slurred as though she’d been on a two-day 
                             bender. She took a deep breath, trying to clear her head from the effects of the drugs. 
                                   “32 days.” His face was still blurry to her, but that was definitely Kaminsky’s voice, slick and disdainful no mat-
                             ter what the occasion. “I am glad to inform you that the procedure was a full success. Infection of the vector was about 
                             99.6%. Genetherapeutic splicing and transformation took place as specified and approved. Physical post-infection 
                             stress was within parameters, and residuals of the virus after genomic reconstruction were completely eliminated by 
                             your own immune system. There were some minor complications during transformation due to unpredictable cross-
                             reactions with silent genes, but those were corrected by gene-technicians here at the facility. No need to worry.” 
                                   A nurse over by the side of her bed did something to her I.V. Her eyelids began to droop, and she had trouble 
                             concentrating on what he was saying. 
                                   “I congratulate you,” Kaminsky said. “You have been genetically reborn.” His artificial smile was the last 
                             thing she saw before the world slipped out of focus again. 
                                   A few days later, she was recovered enough to watch the condensed video record of her transformation pro-
                             cess. It held a horrific fascination for her; she must have watched it twenty times already that day. As the genes 
                             that determined her physical traits had been realigned, she had passed through some monstrous intermediate 
                             stages. She watched as her skull grew and shrank on the screen, shuddering involuntarily at the sight. She was 
                             glad that she hadn’t been conscious. 
                                   Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a stranger in her room. She glanced up and stared yet again; she still could 
                             scarcely accept that the woman she saw was her own reflection in the mirror. One month ago she had been a small black-
                             haired Japanese woman with amygdaline eyes and Asian features. Now she was a Caucasian redhead, nearly 6 inches 
                             taller with a voluptuous body. Even her voice had changed, now a husky contralto. The genetic IDs they ran showed no 
                             match with anyone else, living or deceased. Vocal training that would remove any residual Japanese accentv. 
                                   No one would find her now.

turtleneck and pre-ripped jeans told us that they back up the TF designs regularly, and that an Evo 
suit dropped by once a week to get them out of the server with his key. No problem, right? We just 
used his port. Custom plug, but I’ve got a smart adapter that takes any shape you need.
     “Dotgov—our Matrix man—did his biz and came up empty. He suggested that there was a 
dedicated machine firewalling him out. So out came the spray can. A microdose of wreckers hit the 
doors and we were through and down in the basement.
     “I like old movies. There’s this great ‘flick’—that’s what they were called—that’s about a cen-
tury old. There’s this crazy computer that takes over a house and performs unspeakable experiments. 
Especially in the basement. It’s funny how life imitates art, isn’t it?
     “I’m not talking about the Arcology. I’ve read the files you sent me about that, and while the 
resemblance is striking, I’m actually talking about what we ran into in the basement. We busted 
another door and ran into this drone. It was just like the old movie: a big, 3D tangram, all polygons 
sliding into different configurations, spinning around. It extended a little brassy pyramid of a limb 
that sheared off the top of Dotgov’s head. One of the ‘artists’ chuckled from the top of the stairs (I 
killed him for that, on the way out) as we backed out of the room. I must have hit something worth-
while with my Predator, because that drone toppled over and crumpled a bit.
     “The next door led to the main server. It was off the net, but otherwise had weak security. 
J-Spark got the data. The whole room was filled with this fog. I thought it was just some kind of 
active fire suppression system. I was wrong. J’s face started to melt off halfway through our drive to 
the safe house. I think I’m still around because of the universal blue goo I got installed a few months 
back, but I can’t be sure.
     “The data? It’s all yours, chum. In addition to Tempus Fugit, there’s a huge block of encrypted 
files. I can’t jimmy them; Dotgov could, but he’s gone. I assume they have to do with the thing in the 
basement. Just give me a blood transfusion, top up the blue goo, get anything dangerous out of my 
body, and cut me ten percent.
     “Why so little? Well, there’s one thing I want you to do. Get me data on the VP in charge of 
Nanotech R&D at Evo. Payback’s a bitch.”

                                        The clinic was closed, of course: it absolutely wouldn’t do to have anyone come in unannounced 
                                  during this operation. Orthus looked the doctor over with skepticism; his laid-back demeanor and 
                                  scruffy facial hair didn’t suggest professionalism. Outwardly, he looked to be in his mid-thirties; his 
                                  dark shades and mannerisms hinted at a lifetime of cannabis use. He snarled and looked over at Tani 
                                  and panted questioningly. Locked away in her chemsuit, she saw the world very differently than he 
                                  did, and radiopathically sent over an OK signal. Their other compatriot with magesight wasn’t of 
                                  much use right now, so he’d have to rely on her.
                                        Orthus growled, “We got the data, but it’s still in the head. Also, our nagician needs a new 
                                  hand.” Extensive facial reconstruction had left him virtually incapable of pronouncing the letter M. 
                                  To emphasize his point, he held out the limp form of his companion, shaking him slightly so the 
                                  shredded limb would be more obvious. Parts of the small Asian man sloughed off. Orthus tossed the 
                                  bag onto the table.
                                        The mass of the head proved too much for even the jumbo-meal bag; it tore open, spilling 
                                  General Tso’s chicken everywhere. Dr. Swayne was nonplussed “Dude, that bag is dripping every-
                                  where!” Synthetic chicken grease and cerebral spinal fluid mixed poorly with the blood, leaving spiral 
                                  patterns dribbling across the table. “That is totally uncool. Now I’m gonna to have to disinfect the 
                                  whole room.” The doctor continued to mutter as he snapped gloves into place and put the head into 
                                  a multi-pronged apparatus.
                                        Tani spoke up: “The datalock is tamper resistant. If an unauthorized external feed tries to get 
                                  the data it’ll erase the whole thing.” She was using that tone she used when she hadn’t eaten and 
                                  there was blood on the ground. Orthus knew it well. The doctor waved her off and began jacking 
                                  into his machine.
                                        Remembering his unconscious compatriot, Orthus stopped Dr. Swayne before he had finished 
                                  jacking in. “Our friend is nissing an arn, he needs your helf now.” He shook the comatose man at the 
                                  doctor again.
                                        “You need to calm down, dude. He’s a magician, right? He’ll want a clonal hand, not some off-
                                  the-rack shit.” He looked to Tani for some confirmation, but the impassive faceplate of her chemsuit 
                                  was of little assistance. 
                                        Orthus just looked at him with puppy-dog eyes. “Oh, come on, man! I don’t have a donor clone 
                                  for this guy. It’ll take a month to force-grow a hand for him.” 
                                        The doctor pointed to a spray can on a shelf. “There’s some spray skin. It’ll keep him from leaking 
                                  while I’m working on the head.” He turned back to his work.

                                   Hardcase ran as fast as his augmented muscles would allow, tendons pumping with the effort. He knew he 
                              wouldn’t be fast enough—the hounds chasing his sorry ass would catch up to him before he reached the LZ. He 
                              clutched the sample case closer to his chest, keeping its valuable contents from jostling or falling out of his jacket.
                                   The street samurai remembered hearing that dumb troll Krog’s bellows and the staccato reports from his heavy 
                              pistols, but he hadn’t turned to help. He’d just run. If the others weren’t dead already, they soon would be. 
                                   Hardcase broke out of the thin forest surrounding the lab complex and charged for the low wooded hills 
                              beyond. If he could get across that stretch of open ground before the hunter-killers broke out of the tree line, 
                              he might just be all right.
                                   He realized his mistake immediately. He was out in the open. The dogs had coaxed him in this direction 
                              and flushed him out of cover. How the fuck had they done that? 
                                   He was barely halfway when the dogs came crashing out of the woods. Once those beasties hit open 
                              ground, they soared and were on him in seconds. One ripped at his arm, tearing his gun from his grip. The 
                              others fanned out, circling him rather than attacking.
                                   Hardcase stopped and fell back into a protective stance, popping a spur. As the dogs circled, his attention 
                              focused on their rippling augmented muscles, matte-black dermal sheaths, and gleaming razor claws. He 
                              vaguely registered how the dogs moved as one. 
                                   Two of the mutts kept their distance a little ahead and behind him, in case he decided to make a break 
                              for it. When the others came, they pounced from opposite directions. The first hound darted out of range as he 
                              swung his spur, exposing his side to the chromed teeth of the other dog. 
                                   Something was wrong. This wasn’t how guard dogs acted. This wasn’t familiarity honed with practice, 
                              but a single mind, a single purpose. Hardcase knew metahuman-level intelligence when he saw it—that meant 
                              biodrones!
                                   He fought them off as best he could, but one man against half a dozen hunter-killers didn’t make for 
                              much of a fight. His legs finally buckled and six sets of jaws dug into his flesh.
                                   Over his screams and their disgusting sounds of mayhem, Hardcase heard the whine of engines and felt 
                              a strong wind buffet him and the dogs. Heavy reports of mounted weapons and that familiar staccato rhythm 
                              reached his ears. He felt the dogs get knocked off his body; heard them scatter. 
                                   He couldn’t move, but managed to crack open the one eye the dogs hadn’t ravaged. He saw the most 
                              beautiful thing he’d ever seen in all his thirty-odd years—a helo transport hovering nearby, its running lights 
                              and machineguns flashing in the dusk. Framed in the open hatch was Krog, good ol’ Krog, firing several rounds 
                              toward the trees, presumably toward the remaining hunter-killers.
                                   Krog leaped out, moving quickly over to the downed samurai. The troll looked down. 
                                   “You’ve seen better days, Hardman.”
