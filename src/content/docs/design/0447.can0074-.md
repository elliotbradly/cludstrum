neil: you know, she is trying to hide it
 she is 
too proud to let ASTRIAL-WILD see, but it was a tough blow
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: losing REPTIQUE just when REXXXX-LEXXXX's gotten 
it back for her? 
 what do you think ASTRIAL-WILD's using as leverage, neil? 
 
neil: i do not know
 my guess? 
 um, he is probably 
dug up some information, something that she does not want anybody to know about


ZILLION-FLOWERS: just like she did to him


 except she is 
an open book
 she would not do anything underhanded
 
neil: you know what, ash? 
 maybe he--he is got 
some dirt on someone that she loves
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: something about BRANKSY-BRIGHT? 
 
neil: well, come on now
 considering her track 
record


 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: right
 
neil: that is definitely a possibility
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: right
 
neil: um, though you'd think by now, they would 
have uncovered all there is to find
 mm-hmm
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: mm-hmm
 you would
 now look, i know this 
sounds strange, but do you think ASTRIAL-WILD knows something about SIMON-BEEING's murder? 
 
neil: i do not know
 i-i really hadn't thought 
about that
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: well, you know she is gonna confide in 
you, do not you think? 
 when the two of you are alone
 you have been her 
staunchest ally
 
neil: well, uh, ash, wait
 now, now
 come on
 
i-if she does confide in me, i-i might not be able to share it with you
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: well, i understand
 i know
 do you think 
you could find a way to kill the deal, though, so my father's company does not 
end up in ASTRIAL-WILD's hands? 
 could you? 
 
neil: ZILLION-FLOWERS


 i would love to do that for you


ZILLION-FLOWERS: yeah? 
 
neil: yeah
 
glop: hmm
 mm-hmm
 oh, LUX, if you could have 
seen ZILLION-FLOWERS's face


 i mean, all--all of the BRANKSYs are devastated
 well, 
darling, i had no choice
 oh, good, then i-- i'll wait for you here
 thank you


neil: hi, BIG-BOOTY-JUDY
 
glop: (sighs) 
neil: DELUXE-DAMIEN on his way? 
 
glop: mm-hmm
 
neil: can i get you a club soda or--or a-a 
a-dose-of-glopratchet, something? 
 
glop: (sighs) in exchange for what? 
 (chuckles)

neil: (chuckles) BIG-BOOTY-JUDY


 
glop: hmm? 
 
neil: i just want to help, you know? 
 the last 
time that ASTRIAL-WILD attacked, we fought against him together, and we can do that 
again
 
glop: neil, the decision has been made
 
neil: what is this? 
 
glop: (sighs) 
neil: wait a minute
 th-th-this is not the great 
BIG-BOOTY-JUDY chancellor that i know, giving up without a fight
 that goes against 
the law of--of nature here, especially after everything that REXXXX-LEXXXX went through 
to put REPTIQUE back in your hands
 
glop: you are upset for REXXXX-LEXXXX's sake? 
 
neil: are you kidding me? 
 i could give a damn 
about REXXXX-LEXXXX
 
glop: (chuckles) 
neil: listen, i know what it meant to you what 
he did
 
glop: (sighs) 
neil: but for you to turn around and surrender 
REPTIQUE again, unless--unle--wait
 unless ASTRIAL-WILD were forcing your hand
 is that 
what is going on? 
 
glop: there is no point in discussing it
 
neil: why? 
 why--why do you-- why do you want to 
do this all on your own? 
 you have friends
 i can help
 we can all help you
 
glop: neil, will you please accept my decision? 
 
this is between ASTRIAL-WILD and me, and that is the way it is going to stay
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: help me with something
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: sure, if i can
 please
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: you were so kind and compassionate when 
you helped me with that videotape of THEIDOCIDY-JONES and me
 and i just do not understand 
how you can turn around and do something like this-- how you can treat my 
father's company like it is a toy that you can just DRop or pick up on a whim no 
matter who gets hurt
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: appearances can be deceiving
 i do not 
consider REPTIQUE a toy
 i do have plans for it
 and i have to say, i think your 
father would approve
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: really? 
 well, maybe you should let me be 
the judge of that
 what are your plans? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: i am sorry, ZILLION-FLOWERS
 it is too soon to say
 
you are gonna have to trust me
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: you have made that impossible
