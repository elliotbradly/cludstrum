create your environment description briefs with the following points in mind:

Where are we?
What does this place have to do with the game story?
How does this place relate to the characters?
Where did we come from and where does this place lead?
What does this setting look like?

Who is he/she? Are they a primary or secondary character and how do they relate to the game story?
What do they look like? What are they wearing or carrying with them?
What is their personality like and how does that personality help fulfill their role in the game story?
How do they relate to other characters in the game?
What are their strengths and weaknesses, and how can that affect the game story?
What are the motivating character goals for this character?


Presentation Scheme


1. Where are we; where/when does the story take place?

2. Who are we following along in the story (the protagonist) and why them?

3. Who or what force is opposed to the hero (the antagonist) and why are they in opposition?

4. What do these characters want to accomplish; what is at stake for them?

5. What is the ensuing conflict and why does it exist?

6. How does the action rise; how do things get more tense?

7. What is the final crisis and how does it play out?

8. How do things resolve and wrap up?
