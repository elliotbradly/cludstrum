## A Synopsis of “D-Values and P-Values: The Building Blocks of Meaning” in Doležel’s *Possible Worlds in Literature*

Following the establishment of the Textual Possible World (TPW) as a dynamic, reader-constructed narrative reality, Lubomír Doležel’s third section of *Possible Worlds in Literature* (1998) delves into the internal structure of the TPW itself. This section meticulously details the foundational elements – D-values (descriptive values) and P-values (propositional values) – and how their interplay generates meaning within the narrative. Doležel doesn’t simply define these terms; he explores their hierarchical relationship, their role in establishing world coherence, and how they function as the fundamental building blocks of our understanding of the story world. This synopsis will explore the intricacies of D-values and P-values, their classification, their dynamic interaction, and their significance for literary analysis.

**I. Defining the Building Blocks: D-Values and P-Values Revisited**

As previously established, Doležel posits that the TPW is constructed from two primary types of elements: **D-values (descriptive values)** and **P-values (propositional values)**. 

* **D-values** represent the concrete, observable elements within the narrative world. They are the “what” of the story – the characters, settings, objects, events, and their immediate properties. Examples include “Hamlet is a prince,” “Elsinore Castle is grey and imposing,” “Ophelia carries flowers,” or “Claudius pours poison into Hamlet’s ear.” D-values are the raw data, the sensory details that populate the TPW. They are relatively straightforward and less open to interpretation.
* **P-values** are the propositions, or statements, that can be asserted *about* the D-values. They are the “that” of the story – the qualities, relationships, and implications associated with the descriptive elements. Examples include “Hamlet is melancholic,” “Elsinore Castle symbolizes decay,” “Ophelia is innocent and vulnerable,” or “Claudius is a ruthless murderer.” P-values require interpretation and inference; they move beyond simple observation to ascribe meaning and significance to the D-values.

Doležel emphasizes that P-values are not simply derived from D-values in a one-to-one correspondence. While D-values provide the basis for P-values, the process of formulating a proposition involves abstraction, generalization, and the application of background knowledge. Observing that Hamlet frequently soliloquizes about death (a D-value) doesn’t automatically equate to the P-value “Hamlet is obsessed with mortality”; it requires an interpretive leap.

**II. The Hierarchical Relationship: From Concrete to Abstract**

A crucial aspect of Doležel’s framework is the hierarchical relationship between D-values and P-values. He argues that P-values are organized in a hierarchy, ranging from those that are directly grounded in textual evidence (textual P-values) to those that are more speculative and inferential (non-textual P-values).

* **Lower-Level P-values:** These are closely tied to specific D-values and are relatively uncontroversial. For example, if the text explicitly states “Hamlet is wearing black,” the P-value “Hamlet is dressed in black” is a lower-level P-value.
* **Higher-Level P-values:** These are more abstract and require greater inference. For example, inferring that Hamlet’s black clothing symbolizes mourning or his inner turmoil is a higher-level P-value. It relies on cultural conventions and interpretive judgment.

This hierarchy is not rigid, but it provides a useful framework for analyzing the degree to which a P-value is supported by the text. The stability and coherence of the TPW depend on the consistency of these P-values, with lower-level P-values serving as a foundation for higher-level interpretations.

**III. Classifying P-Values: Attributes, Relations, and Events**

Doležel further categorizes P-values into three main types:

* **Attributive P-values:** These describe the qualities or characteristics of D-values. Examples include “Hamlet is intelligent,” “Elsinore Castle is ancient,” or “Ophelia is beautiful.”
* **Relational P-values:** These describe the relationships between D-values. Examples include “Hamlet is the son of the late King Hamlet,” “Claudius is married to Gertrude,” or “Ophelia is in love with Hamlet.”
* **Event P-values:** These describe the events that occur within the TPW. Examples include “Claudius murders King Hamlet,” “Hamlet stages a play to test Claudius’s guilt,” or “Ophelia drowns.”

This classification helps to clarify the different ways in which P-values contribute to the construction of the TPW. Attributive P-values establish the properties of individual elements, relational P-values define their connections, and event P-values drive the narrative forward.

**IV. The Dynamic Interaction: P-Values Shaping Perception of D-Values**

Doležel emphasizes that the relationship between D-values and P-values is not unidirectional. While D-values provide the basis for P-values, P-values also shape our perception of D-values. Our understanding of a character’s attributes (P-values) influences how we interpret their actions (D-values). For example, knowing that Hamlet is melancholic (a P-value) will affect how we interpret his soliloquies (D-values).

This dynamic interaction highlights the interpretive nature of reading. We don’t simply passively receive information about the TPW; we actively construct meaning by relating D-values to P-values and vice versa.

**V. Coherence and Consistency: Maintaining the Integrity of the TPW**

The coherence and consistency of the TPW depend on the harmonious relationship between its D-values and P-values. Contradictions or inconsistencies between P-values can disrupt the believability of the world and undermine the reader’s immersion. However, Doležel acknowledges that literary narratives often deliberately introduce ambiguities and inconsistencies, not as flaws, but as stylistic devices to create tension, provoke thought, or challenge conventional expectations.

The key is not necessarily to eliminate all inconsistencies but to understand how they function within the narrative. A skilled author can use inconsistencies to create a sense of unease, to highlight the complexities of human nature, or to subvert the reader’s expectations.

**VI.  Implications for Literary Analysis: Unpacking Narrative Meaning**

Doležel’s framework provides a powerful tool for literary analysis. By systematically analyzing the D-values and P-values within a text, critics can gain a deeper understanding of how the narrative world is constructed, how meaning is generated, and how the author manipulates our perceptions.

Analyzing the hierarchy of P-values can reveal the underlying assumptions and ideological biases embedded within the text. Examining the relationships between D-values and P-values can illuminate the thematic concerns of the narrative. And identifying inconsistencies and ambiguities can shed light on the author’s artistic intentions.

In conclusion, Doležel’s meticulous exploration of D-values and P-values provides a foundational understanding of how meaning is constructed within the TPW. It moves beyond simply describing the elements of the story world to explaining the dynamic processes that shape our understanding of it, solidifying his contribution to narratology and offering a robust framework for literary analysis.
