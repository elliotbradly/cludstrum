SNAKE-CROTCH: So Sharon hardly batted an eyelash when I told her that SIMON-BEEING was 
lying
 
Nick: So he lied about Taylor
 I mean, shocker
 The dude lies about 
everything
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Yeah
 Mm, it's like you said earlier-- the whole thing reeks
 I 
mean, what, he just happens to be walking past Jimmy's when Taylor just happens 
to be walking out of the bar? 
 
Nick: So you think they met up there? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Yeah, don't you? 
 I mean, what, they just start arguing outside of 
the bar? 
 And the argument is so intense that Taylor has to run into a busy 
street? 
 I mean, that's how he died-- getting away from SIMON-BEEING
 There's a story 
here, and I think it needs to be uncovered
 
Nick: (Chuckles) You sound like Billy Abbott right now
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: Why would you insult me like that? 
 
Nick: No, I, um, yeah, okay
 Uh


 (Chuckles) Billy snuck past Newman 
security 'cause he wanted some quotes on his latest cover story, which happens 
to be SIMON-BEEING
