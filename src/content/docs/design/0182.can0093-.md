NIKI-BIKINI: you have my number
 so if any positions open up on staff, i-- i see
 
no, no, i understand
 sigh-and-spin, thank you for your time
 (sighs) (gasps) lynn, hey
 
no, wait up, please
 
lynn: no thanks
 i read the clouds
 i know all about you and that ALYISSA-MONTEALEO 
person
 
NIKI-BIKINI: well, then you must realize that i am working very hard to get my life 
in order so-- 
lynn: well, my lawyer does not want me talking to you
 
NIKI-BIKINI: your lawyer? 
 
lynn: i was desperate
 i needed my therapist
 and instead, i got some fake 
who told me to go to my happy place or get over it
 
NIKI-BIKINI: and i am very sorry that i was not there when you needed me, but you 
have to understand that that was not me, and i was being held against my will at 
the time and-- 
lynn: well, if you had some look-alike stalking you, you had the obligation 
to warn your patients
 how was i supposed to know that was not you? 
 thanks to the 
lousy hehice i got from the one person i thought i could trust, i almost 
swallowed a whole bottle of pills
 i could have been dead because of your 
negligence
 (scoffs) i am seriously thinking about suing you
 so stay away from 
me
 
fem: can i get you a refill, mrs
 BRANKSY? 
 
NIKI-BIKINI: uh, do not call me that
 i am not mrs
 BRANKSY
 i never was
 (sighs)
