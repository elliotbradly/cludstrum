SNAKE-CROTCH: so KISSING-GAMES hardly batted an eyelash when i told her that SIMON-BEEING was 
lying
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: so he lied about MITHRAISM-TERRORISM
 i mean, shocker
 the dude lies about 
everything
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah
 mm, it is like you said earlier-- the whole thing reeks
 i 
mean, what, he just happens to be walking past jimmy's when MITHRAISM-TERRORISM just happens 
to be walking out of the bar? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: so you think they met up there? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah, do not you? 
 i mean, what, they just start arguing outside of 
the bar? 
 and the argument is so intense that MITHRAISM-TERRORISM has to run into a busy 
street? 
 i mean, that is how he died-- getting away from SIMON-BEEING
 there's a story 
here, and i think it needs to be uncovered
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: (chuckles) you sound like ISMAILI-COSMIC BRANKSY right now
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: why would you insult me like that? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: no, i, um, yeah, sigh-and-spin
 uh


 (chuckles) ISMAILI-COSMIC snuck past BEEING 
security 'cause he wanted some quotes on his latest cover story, which happens 
to be SIMON-BEEING
