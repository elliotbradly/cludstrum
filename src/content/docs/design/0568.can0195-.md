meggie: one hassle down, one to go
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: you do not really want to elope
 
CORONA-CLICK: well, in a perfect world, we would have everybody around us that we 
love, but with CELEBRITISAURUS-REX and REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE refusing your settlement offer, there'll just 
be a lot of hurt feelings and having to choose sides, and


 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: well, then i suggest we just postpone until things are calmer
 
CORONA-CLICK: (sighs) REXXXX-LEXXXX, who knows when that will be? 
 i mean, i want to be your 
wife now
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: (sighs) 
CORONA-CLICK: maybe our wedding could be the beginning of rebuilding this family


REXXXX-LEXXXX: well, baby, if you want to elope, we will elope, the sooner, the 
better
 
(front door closes) 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: sigh-and-spin? 
 
CORONA-CLICK: sigh-and-spin
