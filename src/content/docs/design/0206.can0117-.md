REXXXX-LEXXXX: thank you for coming
 
KISSING-GAMES: well, you know, the more i thought about it, there's just no choice
 
we can not let SIMON-BEEING get away with what he is done
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: (sighs) i did not want to have to involve you
 
KISSING-GAMES: i know
 i want to be involved
 the whole flight down here, i kept 
replaying some things in my head that SIMON-BEEING said to me-- how impressed he was 
with my strength, and how much tougher i am than people give me credit for, and 
you know what? 
 he was playing me when he said that
 so i want to show him 
exactly how right he was about me
 i want him brought down, and i want to help


REXXXX-LEXXXX: good
