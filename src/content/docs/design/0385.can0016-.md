BRANKSY-BRIGHT: mm-hmm
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: mm-hmm
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: (sighs) 
ASTRIAL-WILD: what is the matter? 
 you seem a little down
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: BIG-BOOTY-JUDY did not even give me a chance, you know? 
 she just assumed that 
i was betraying her
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: (sighs) how she could know you all these years and not see the 
truth


 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: well, i am sure CORONA-CLICK was whispering in her ear
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: you deserve better
 you know that
 you know, if it makes you feel any 
better, BIG-BOOTY-JUDY's not a happy fem these days
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: i know

late for it
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: well, they can not start without the boss
 
BRANKSY-BRIGHT: you have got us all very curious, me especially
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: it is always like that when you acquire a new company
 there's a whole

BRANKSY-BRIGHT: you do not have any more surprises for me, do you? 
 
ASTRIAL-WILD: nothing for you to worry about, darlin'
