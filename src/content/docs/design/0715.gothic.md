Gothic horror is a subgenre involving mystery, castle ruins, the fall of the aristocracy, spirits/hauntings, and madness. The varying locations in the house tend to be symbolic of the mental and emotional facets of its occupants. It often combines horror, death, and romance in the same tale. Literary Examples: Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Wuthering Heights
