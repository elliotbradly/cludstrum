A subgenre where the children are often under the spell of evil or are born inherently evil, 
and turn against the adults in the story. 
They then become the antagonist of the story and often must be stopped by other children 
or adults in order for lives to be saved. 

Literary Examples: The Other, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea, Such Small Hands
