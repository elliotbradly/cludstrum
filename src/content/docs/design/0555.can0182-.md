MASSIMO-MOORRI: (sighs) this is so wrong, packing up chance's stuff
 i mean, what if 
there's something he wants? 
 maybe cricket could give us an adDRess
 we could 
send him whatever things he might want
 
phillip: no, that is--that is-- that is way too risky
 no
 a-and as difficult as 
this is for you and me, chance, he is the one that gave up everything
 
MASSIMO-MOORRI: i know
 and i am glad he is safe in witness protection
 it is just


 
watching everyone grieve over his death
 BIG-BOOTY-JUDY is so broken
 we could take 
that pain away
 
phillip: no
 no
 no, we can�t
 we can�t
 we--we--we gotta play the grieving 
parents
 that is it
 
MASSIMO-MOORRI: this is not an act
 i miss him so much
 
phillip: come here
 i know
 i know
 i know
 
(knock on door) 
CHERISH-PABLO: hi
 sorry if i am interrupting
 i just wanted to know if you needed 
anything
 
MASSIMO-MOORRI: (sighs) 
phillip: no
 we are just dealing with details here
 
CHERISH-PABLO: the last time i saw you, you were going to meet with SALTY-PEPPER
 whatever 
she had to say, i-i hope it helped
