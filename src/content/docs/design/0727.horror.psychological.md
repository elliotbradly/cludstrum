In this subgenre, 
the character's mind becomes his or her own undoing, such as a serial killer. 
These stories often involve human fears, mental instability, and emotional insecurities. 
Psychological horror is often similar to supernatural and haunting subgenres, 
because the protagonist may be confusing the horrors plaguing their mind with something supernatural. 
You will often encounter an unreliable narrator in this genre. 

Literary Examples: American Psycho, Haunted, Diary Of A Madman
