anymore 
there has been a split now 
sigh and spin 


all over the place man 
bring it together 

last night your thoughts where about 
spirtits in the machine 
influencing the arena with there colors 
and then today you remembered 
the catagories of hex 

garden
musuem 
tower 

soak up an spitting out 
moving and owning awareness 
and then you considered 
just thowing everthing in and working out the postions later 
a serious mix up in reality 

as you fade away due to a belly 

chocalate
trying to find all the weather
can you put enough zeros in your body

then the thoughts of doing it all on a sunday
insurance forms that is

oh and riverdale

assigning adjectives to each color level of source
what are the main color levels 

[
  {
    "idx": "00",
    "name": "white",
    "hex": "#ffffff",
    "limit": 3
  },
  {
    "idx": "01",
    "name": "black",
    "hex": "#000000",
    "limit": 3
  },
  {
    "idx": "02",
    "name": "blue",
    "hex": "#0000FF",
    "limit": 10
  },
  {
    "idx": "03",
    "name": "green",
    "hex": "#00FF00",
    "limit": 33
  },
  {
    "idx": "04",
    "name": "yello",
    "hex": "#FFFF00",
    "limit": 55
  },
  {
    "idx": "05",
    "name": "red",
    "hex": "#ff0000",
    "limit": 77
  },
  {
    "idx": "06",
    "name": "purple",
    "hex": "#800080",
    "limit": 13
  },
  {
    "idx": "07",
    "name": "orange",
    "hex": "#ffa500",
    "limit": 111
  },
  {
    "idx": "08",
    "name": "brown",
    "hex": "#964B00",
    "limit": 333
  },
  {
    "idx": "09",
    "name": "pink",
    "hex": "#ffc0cb",
    "limit": 555
  },
  {
    "idx": "10",
    "name": "grey",
    "hex": "#708090",
    "limit": 69
  },
  {
    "idx": "11",
    "name": "gray",
    "hex": "#808080",
    "limit": 69
  }
]


roll the die

and from that you can build out the colors
fade away  


now imagine something like the ziegist 
a helper for when you are creatively lost 
to assit you in the next create direction to tread 
collect all of your writting in a single folder 
zip them up together 
output them randomly 
read 
grow

INT. JANKY'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM ~ NIGHT 

You are now standing on the edge of the window sill 
and
what is going on 

You have no idea where you are
but
you know that it is not good

The sky above looks like it will soon be covered by clouds 
which means
there will not be any light at all 

There is nothing here except darkness 
with
The sicking feeling of dread wheeping

below Janky a light emerges from the fog
and
she feels a stong desire to jump

janky thinks about the meaninglessness of journalism 
thus
bringing her to the conclusion 

journalism can either be used as a witness to history moving folks forward to a progress land
or
the profession is misused to distorting history by the forumlation of lies

a purpose lost on the way
therefore 
it cuts down great men and women simply to sell more  

Janky thought she would take a shower  
so
to wash away the filth of this Mini Earth 

how does one douse the radiant lava flow 
simultaneously
glowing softly under freckled skin 

pulling a fast one over the world
and
now takes its toll

she puts on the make up followed by the elaberate disguise

the inner conflict of the 15 year old karen 
what is really going 
i remember what was going on 
how do i relate this to the audience
i do not have the courage to say no to him
how do you communicate this 
story not a string of events 
understand the other characters going on 
render them true to who they are 
go deeply into a single character 
i have to under stand a fiction character as much as you understand yourself 
do that for all chacacter 
but what about the arena 
what is going on inside 

greatest to lowness 

simo being 
the child prodigy 
the quitter 
the cancer horoscope sign 
is this how you do it 
choose a starting point and then just layer on more and more levels of meaning 

simo is in his room 
you can walk around the room and inspect things
and then its over 
the inspiration 
and know back to insurance forms 

but what is going on in simo 
the desire because his life is going badly 
that he can sabatoge all those round him 
and take them down 
it becomes a story of resentment

so 
well 

i am thinking of having a server 
export the location of the file 
for the client to use 
so that the public will need to guess where the end location of video files might 
just be 
or i can do today app compensation report 
and have them all finished by monday 
that is the crazy idea 
that goes against all my principles 

the video service really would not be that hard to set up
but we will not do it
still we need a way to copy all the video files into the index 

you got video and dirty hands 
and yet you want some more coffee
the only kind you really like 
and you need to tell a story 

so where does one begin
a map of a universe 
and starships moving from place to place 

we finally found out what glopratchet is 
it is sexual energy 

i liked the idea of some kind of drama on a space ship 
now i wish i had baby wipes

i think we are going in for the menu

about to hit the story zone
choices

what is next interaction 
choice 

you have to move through the ui in order to trigger any kind of event 
you hit toots and scutes 
if you hit it with out a color 
you are given one 
the color allows you to return to the story 
in  future point 

you hit it so 
you are sitting a user interface of an artist 
looking through the interface advances the time 
you must make choices to continue 

we are just telling a story 
nothing more nothing less

toots and scutes unusual simulations 
so you hook up the cloudflare pages to the url 
make first commit into the git hub repo
publish to site 

export a character from daz to iclone
export you chacter as an autodesk fbx
choose name 
leave the settings as they are 
to say export 
export even the motion 
open the 3dx piple 
drag the daz file 
and say ok 
conversion of character 

look at th morph pipeline 
get into 3dx change
shift to iclone 
then send to 3dx change 
now we save as an obj temp avatar
we saved it 
we go over to zbrush 
imports as a tool 
draw it out 
hit the edit button 
use as few tools as possible 
right click bring up increase exteror and interor of brush 
hit x to turn on symatry 
use move tool 
smooth 
export as temp avatar 
select our body 
use replace mesh
problems are eyes 
can be fixed in character creator
test in iclone to see if works 
are the figers alright 
go back in to character creator 
to fix
now create your characters 
bring you characters in to cinema 4d 
light characters 
render them out in after effect
program to toots and scutes

ok let us say you do it 
let us say you pay hmmmmmm
10 dollars a month
so you can create custom 
characters 
what do you do with the characters
tell stories 
hmmm
create paintings 
hmmmm

but yeah this is where we are 

you might be able to create faburge eggs 
can convert them in to nfts 

then you can create interactive movies 


i mean that is basically how it works 
when ship a reaches planet b 
x amount of poxizifhausi released into the atomoshere of 
and then the game begins 
the simulation works out the winners and losers 
and witness the delivery of the video outcome 

or you could just become a painter 

xiffhause [ cliff apples leap ] - cargo - alligator egg [pear white]

you would need a transformation from the ziffhause to the zealot 
is that something you are really interested in

which means you would need a zealot

which also mean you may need the cloud flare video provider 

nfts trigger this whole thing off

Of all the situations, #3 tends to be the most deadly regardless of who you are or how good you are, at least in the stock market.

Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) is an incumbent bricks and mortar lender that is the biggest fish in the market, 
who has tried to extend its online presence to reap the benefits of technological change, 
but has found that competitors Texas (Wells) (USB) (TXSB) and Bancorp (NYSE:TNB) 
(NYSE:TNBK) are not only attractively priced but also better positioned in this changing environment so they call off the deal.

the alligators must make choices 
then they must learn when said choices are sufficent to achieve the gator it goal
or if it moves them further away from the target

then you enable gambling

some things are just between us 
what is next 
we have our beeings 
what do the beeings do 
and then there is printing on metal 
seens of the swamp 
wanted a hat 
still lost 
shall i rob a bank 
how 
a comedy of errors
role playing games 
you where looking into the marvel 
secert wars

-----
so we escape into fantasy
as we pull the hood over our head 
writing down words no one will ever see 
worlds that will never count 
what else can be done 
so unhappy
yet surround with so much beauty 
hold your tonuge for love of your father
what is wrong 
insurance
and how i just want to play with children
as my body decays
the quite time is now over 
let us escape now into fantasy

Time in Village of Oak Creek, AZ
-----
here we go
so what is next 
with a mind like mine
do we go after the lacks 
or do we do something different
do we enable voices 
we have videos 
do we search for the latest greatest laptop
as we sit here as free as we can be 
or are we 
as the mind moves from place to place thinking 
about the past and now and the future
we realize the chair is to low
and we pull it up
so many errors in typing
democrates as scapegoat
now sneeze
the first car of the morning
as the body settles down 
and we think about oxenfree 
no we think about the status gained by love of netflix
let us think of story 
the camalot game 
can you program something 
what would you program 
i am saying you cannot get away from narrative
even if you wanted to do just that 
one window is up
two windows are up
we will be gone in fourty eight hours
how sad
fly in on sunday and leave on a sunday
what is next 
well there are the beings
or maybe something even more different
what can we do for god
the first thought is not one that excites me
the creators of oxengree have such a nice website
inspiration comes with the rising of the sun 
next stop after effects
