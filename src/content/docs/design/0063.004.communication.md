the four year old drama queen jumps up and down 
she her touche her toes in the most amazing fashion
while her uncle claps energetically 

then she runs and runs and runs laps around the kitchen table inheritance
the grand father wants her to slow down 
she wants to play the jingle song again 
the grand mother says no  

jingle the elf has returned yet again
this time brining a book 

a few days before the same uncle could not control himself 
and gobbled down a hand full of marshmallows
leaving a father to explain why this privilege had been granted 

something about wanting jingle to come visit them all 
and then the brother in law discussing how the uncle would be getting a bag a dirt
and the same uncle wondered if the brother in law meant a bag of death 

the fear of not being about to turn the spinout of surprise off at three pm
leading to tears for his loved ones 

the hardest blow 
thinking i am out of sight 
mom makes gestures demonstrating her belief 
i am lesser

uncle uncle 
do you want to play kippie yuppie with me
