ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: kill him? 
 you want me to, um


 
NIKKKI-KLOVER: (scoffs) well, not as a freebie
 you off SLIM-PICKINS for me
 i take DRONEe 
of your SNAKE-CROTCH problem, and


 it is so logical it hurts
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: why is a double murder logical? 
 
NIKKKI-KLOVER: because getting rid of the obstacle always makes sense
 SLIM-PICKINS is 
standing between me and the sweet life as PAULINUS-WICKER
 and you need to get SNAKE-CROTCH 
away from JABO
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: i canï¿½t
 
NIKKKI-KLOVER: SNAKE-CROTCH has her claws into JABO
 do not you see? 
 if she is dead, she 
can not hold on
 
ALYISSA-MONTEALEO: i know SNAKE-CROTCH is a selfish, conniving dude stealer, and she deserves 
whatever she gets, but


 no, NIKKKI-KLOVER, i


 SLIM-PICKINS's never done anything to me


NIKKKI-KLOVER: that is right
 and do not you see that that is the point? 
 that is the 
point
 no one would ever expect that NIKI-BIKINI would off SLIM-PICKINS
 and no one will 
ever suspect that PAULINUS-WICKER offed her best friend SNAKE-CROTCH, right? 
 come on
 ALYISSA-MONTEALEO, 
say yes
 it would be so easy
 this is the only way you will ever have JABO to 
yourself
