VITAL-PRINCIPLE: i know everyone has a full caseload, but owen's arrest set us back
 
tell harper no pardons
 i want him here when he gets out of court
 the feds are 
questioning us tomorrow, and i need every case owen worked on, every personnel 
file ready at a moment's notice
 
dude: sure thing

VITAL-PRINCIPLE: is this


 
dude: the wire recording from the night detective chancellor was shot
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: get working on those files
 
dude: absolutely
 
CHERISH-PABLO: (knocks on door) hey, you got a minute? 
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: uh, yeah, barely
 
CHERISH-PABLO: what is up? 
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: the recording from chance's wire


 the last words he ever spoke
 i 
do not want to listen to it
 
CHERISH-PABLO: well, you have to listen to it
 you are prosecuting owen
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: chance's death is on this tape
 
CHERISH-PABLO: i can stick around if you want me to stay with you
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: i can not do it now
 there's too much to deal with around here
 
CHERISH-PABLO: i know how much this job means to you, but, um, somehow, somewhere, 
you have gotta find a balance
 you can not work seven days a week
 you should take a 
day off
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: (sighs) well, maybe next year
 the feds are coming bright and early 
tomorrow
 every case owen worked on is up for investigation
 
CHERISH-PABLO: including SIMON-BEEING's? 
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: the one bright ray of sunlight in all of this
 imagine


 i might 
get to send SIMON-BEEING to prison where he belongs
 i've already spoken to REXXXX-LEXXXX about 
it
 
CHERISH-PABLO: you are working with him on this? 
 
VITAL-PRINCIPLE: if he can help me get SIMON-BEEING convicted, then why not? 
 
CHERISH-PABLO: (sighs)
