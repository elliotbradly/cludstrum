testing do you have something different here to work with 
checking out the beast 
looks like it still works to me

05.19.20-08.19


i just do not know 
i can not see it 

unless the ui is a map of the world 
and all the characters are going about there business

the vampire diaries as love triangle 

you play as the suprnals and 
you have limited resouces due to the apis hori to slightly modify 
a small town called lickskillet


what story do you want to tell
the story of staying away from john dukes 

you would have an artist 
who values beauty 
silent you hate greasy galloon 
but that builds 
and of course in one thread he is 
murdered because he murderd you 

a story generator 
now we are getting somewhere
the characters exist between two states 
blessed and the bounded 
an if i remember there were different tiers 
depending on the tiers 
activates different transformations 
there transformations influence choices 
the tiers influence targets 
the simulation itself provides the limation 

when the simulation is started 
the beginning states of all characters are calculated 
then they go about there business 
their internal color shifts 
as they make choices 

tell me a story 
orbie mayhaw wants 
orbie mayhaw wants to make guns 
now if she is blessed the guns 
are fun 
if she is bounded the guns are horrifiging 

the book talks about an object of desire 
that every story is a story about an object of desire 

this is a game 
now in this game there is not a single character 
there are many 
and you sit back and watch them 
like a play 
or you can effect the environment 

it would need to generate scripts 

the town itself would need an object of desire 
















































core values at stake 
brain damage story 

but you are not making
core values 

target 100 percent beauty
limit heath passion freedom
choices 

Beauty/Hideousniss


Health/weakness
Smart
Winning

what you 



losing control of you mind 
conflicts 



now what 
shortcut key to time and date 

not excited about the future 
God has a plan for me 
but boy i do not know how i feel about it 
wait a second 
i do know how i feel about it 
it feels me with disgust 
the idea of my not creating things feels me with disgust 
but i feel like i can not get anything going 
so i am now looking at places on air bnb to stay 
in the month of june 

now i wait and wish inspiration would take over 
give me visions please 
the last one was a girl dancer amoung the alligators 
yesterday was such a wash 

no new ideas 
just an empty mind
i just feel like i got nothing 
the scariest thing 
was blood for blood 
alright so you have this character who is really into freedom 
i really got nothing 
i just sit here with nothing 
i am going to end up building nothing 
i really wanted this to be a place that inspired genius 
but i got nothing 

i mean you could go through the menu tutorials 
you could even create dialoge 
maybe make a character move 
maybe make  a character kill
i got nothing besides a desire to input data
in a silly ui and check my email
and clean my room 
but i can not make up too much noise 
so tempting to release and see what happens 
a list of gerunds 
at least that is something 
creating a program that spits out gerunds








so the parents did everything they could 
the problems was me 









who to blame for a failed life

act / reaction




a unit of action/reaction. 
An action starts a beat; 
a corresponding reaction
ends it.

    BEAT 1: Turning on the charm/Gearing up for trouble.
    BEAT 2: Propositioning her/Calling him an idiot.
    BEAT 3: Claiming his innocence/Avoiding conflict.
    BEAT 4: Playing for pity/Blaming him.
    BEAT 5: Looking for a way out/Giving him a way out.
    BEAT 6: Laying it on the line/Buying time.
    BEAT 7: Asking for trouble/Crossing the line.
    BEAT 8: Cornering her/Belittling him.
    BEAT 9: Daring her to cross him/Denying his worth.
    BEAT 10: Asking nice/Giving him a last way out.
    BEAT 11: Inviting the worst/Pulling her punch.
    BEAT 12: Doubting himself/Firing her first barrel.
    BEAT 13: Firing her second barrel/Killing her with words.


    BEAT 1: Urging Niles to accept failure/Blaming their failure on Frasier.
    BEAT 2: Calling Niles an idiot/Calling Frasier a snob.
    BEAT 3: Calling Niles a petulant child/Calling Frasier an upstaging
ham.
    BEAT 4: Calling Niles a masochist/Calling Frasier a sadist.
    BEAT 5: Calling Niles a crybaby/Calling Frasier a show-off.
    BEAT 6: Defending his face/Attacking Frasier’s face.

    BEAT 2: Calling her a killjoy/Calling their life a misery.

    BEAT 4: Ignoring her/Ridiculing his idea.
    BEAT 5: Blaming her/Hiding her guilt.
    BEAT 6: Calling her selfish/Giving in.
    Ruth surrenders for a moment to listen to what he has to say.
    As Walter acts out the “coffee klatch” in Beat 7, the scene takes on a
lighter, almost amusing tone. The mood rises toward the positive, and we
begin to feel that Ruth might take his side. But when he mentions Bobo, she
reacts with suspicion, and the scene swings back toward a deeper negative,
building to the turning point at Beat 11.
    BEAT 7: Seducing her/Smelling a rat.
    BEAT 8: Playing the businessman/Foreseeing disaster.
    BEAT 9: Proving his worldliness/Rejecting his folly.
    BEAT 10: Placating him/Accusing her of disloyalty.
    BEAT 11: Swinging a moral hammer/Coping with defeat.
    Beat 11 climaxes Walter’s scene intention. He realizes that Ruth will
never help him get his mother’s money. Walter has failed again. This blow
silences him for a moment, and the scene takes a breath while Walter
gathers his anger and unleashes the scene’s second movement.
    First he must somehow bandage his wounded ego. So in Beat 12 he tries
pleading for Ruth’s understanding, but then in Beats 13 and 14 he turns on
her to blame her and all black women for his failure. Finally she nails him
with the truth.
    BEAT 12: Begging for sympathy/Ignoring his plea.
    BEAT 13: Accusing her of not loving him/Accusing him of living in a
fantasy.
    BEAT 14: Blaming her for his failure/Blaming him for his failure.
    Beat 14 climaxes both the second movement and the scene as Ruth
forces Walter to confront his responsibility for his own miserable life.
    BEAT 15: Clinging to his lame excuse/Sneering at his self-deception.
    BEAT 16: Soothing his wounded ego/Retreating into her fears.


story 
scene 
dialouge 

inciting incent 
character holds soverigty over her existance 
untill something happens 
throws the life of the hero out of kilter 

story values 
binarys of postive or negative 
life of death 
truth or lie
justice or unjustice

anchors content on a core value 
scene begins with a postive charge changes to negative
wane weaker negative 

opening charge 

the turning pont
a value at stake in the scene changes 

a human desire to return to balance


storytelling is taking many different desires 
and puts them into a stream of events 

object of desire 
that what he must have to put his life back to balance

super intention deepest need
example gain inner peace through public victory
 
object of desire : objective , concrete
super intention : subjective, generic 

object of desire will return balance

emotional hunger drives the want 

conciously want
subcounciously need
motavation the why
if gets it will it satisfiy 

mostly irrational
scene intention 
what the character immeditaly wants 
moment by moment in relation to the super intention
closer to or away from scene intention

scene intenion
what he wants right now 
when he gets if the scene is over

actions and reactions

background desires puts limits on the characters
 
hight context culture: realtional, conservative
many things can be left un said ; low diversity
communitee over the individual 
extreme ecomomy and specific word choice 
few words for complex message 

low context: explain at great lenght 

forces of antagonism 
designs actions that she believes will result in rections 
from her world that will bring her closer to a balance life 

world reacts  differently in powerful contrast with what she expected
may move her closer to or away from her object of desire

things will not happen as she expected 


types of conflicts
physical: time space everything material 
social : forces of instituion; religion, corperaton, pyramid of power
personal : intimacy between family and friends
inner : how to cope when you body breaks down  

these four forces build in power 
hero must expand will and her mental, physical, and soulful, emotional capctties must grow to return to balance

spine of action 
traces the quest to the object of desire
diven by super intention 
stuggle againt atgonistic forces 
crisis decsion to cimlaxic choice 

other people mostly obstacles 
which results in talk 

desire 
sense of anatagoinism
choice of action 
action and reaction 
expression - activity that carries action in to the world 
talk, smile, throwing a plate 

secert place incomplete 
dream of creative truimph will you give balance 

pursuit of literay achievement
spine of action
desire 
sense of antagoism
choice of action 
action reaction 
expression

progression of conflict 
forces of antagonism build
calling for greater capicities in him
great and greater jepordy 
greater and greater willpower
to make more risk taking descions 
exhaust all possible actons except for one
most powerful and focus conflict in the life of the hero
must choice one final action to put the life back in balance

makes a decsion 
takes a climatic action
gets the object of desire 
or fails to get it for eterinty 

ever scene must a value at stake 

ever scene should contain a turing point
there must be a change 
further from or closer to object of desire

turning point 
is an action 
or a revelation - unknown fate 
or both 

if it there is no change 
then the scene is exposition 
filled non event 

progression continuos topping of other actions and events
must top for better or worse 

each turing point must top the previous turing point 

each scene must surpass the value change in the preceding scene

action reaction tops previous beat
beats of behavior that must top 
around the scenes turning point 

beat

force of antagoism 
getting to the piece of information
you really have been wanting to learn 
and then you about to get it something happens that make you feel overwhelming farther from your intended goal 


































































crisis scene 



















where there was a shortcut key here 
to add the date and time 
i am sure that will be forth coming 
so there is some kind of blood issue in the world 
and the PETA group destroys the research 
there should be some scientist character 
that is all that i got from my run 
need some food now

a characters hearts breaks 
because she could not attempt to create what she dream of 
the tears begin to dry 
and for a moment she attempts to feel the as close as she can to the center of creation 
and it feels so good 
the beauty 
her body tenses up 
if she dies she does not care 
she clasps the bar on the bed with great strength 
she begins to imagine the transition from one code form to the next 
she disconnects from the world to pour out some useless thoughts 
not to be disturbed 
the thoughts of a journey 
a leaving 
she imagines a character accepting a job offer 
and then the image of camp indians 
her great form 
that speaks to her in her dreams 

simo beeing shows up and offers her a chance to change her life 

the target of tear 
to roll down the cheek 
the limit of a tear 
the size of the tear it self 
the choice of a tear 
roll left or roll right 

camp indians 
the totally free human beeing 
iona something 
into camp indians 

a character who desires creative power 
more than anything 

transform the body in a hundred days 

the target 
just a taste of the creative power of GOD 

limits
what GOD allows 

choices 
do glopratchet 
exercise 

to feel it for a second 
but of course you want to stay there 

the lose of ultimate freedom 
not a choice 
during this certain amount of time 
you must put data into the sytem 

how can you not taste the create power of GOD 
and not come away unchanged 

the problem with self acutalization 
is that you always get old 
and its a constant battle with time 

is it better to have it and lose it 
than to never have had it at all 

i imagine camp indians self acutlizing her self fully 
but she can not hold on to it 
it may be granted for a season 
but then how can she continue the touch 

there is some element of life streaming tech 
that simo can offer 
grow your fans 

the third person persective is the a drone 
that records your actions 

the first step is to get a ui screen a going 
get a ui screen a going 
with c++ code 

imagine that feeling constanly 
of the moment on the bed where you wanted to swing 

is emotion a floating point number 
or three floating point numbers 

or is it a heap 
that rise and falls 

kamp indians

a ballerina 
a dancer 
who floats amoung the alligators 
stealing there teeth 

neir automa 

who is her adversary 
peta

Persons for the Enslaved Treatment of Americans 
they live in tents and let the animals roam free in there houses

kali karol kitten 
kkk 

i feel the connection once again 

simo : i highly recommend you specialize in one product 
iona : what item presents the most oppertunity for growth 
simo : oh i would say the teeth 

must get the human body inside the engine 
and make it dance 

you must improve your own body 
100 hundred push ups 
100 sit ups 
100 squats 

must become more flexable 

must restrict the freedom of others 
so you can have freedom yourself 

you need to create the locations 
you need to create the characters 
got to make a character dance
the human body is a beautiful thing

eats her flesh is a weakness

a game that makes you see the world
in a total different light 

































camp indians 
is 
































































































































































i guess i feel like there 
is a part of the game where you work out 
so silly 
i do not have anything


coffee number two as the tummy resists 
what stop is next 
i do not know 
we will put a cover on it this time 
i have no imagination so there fore i type what i see 
instead of what could be
i had an imagingation once 
it imgained things like fat black woman robots picking up trash
in a future utopia 
now i do not know what to do beside maybe get some ui going in unreal 
the creative spark is gone
limits 
targets 
choices
so i looked up places to stay 
in bushwick 
and found an ideal location

menus 

just did not have the feeling 
enjoyed a little desire for a breif second 
then it faded 














its about three seconds to lift
off

yeah my only complaint with this lap top is how it only has two usb ports 
can you type on this new keybarods more accurtatley than the other one 
can you moew faster than betfore 

you cn can still look off intot the distance and type away 
as the screen is slightly furthter from you face 
or you could hook up the new screen 

i do not know where i am headed and i suppose these thoughts are just a waste of time but that is all i have now 

all kinds of ideas enter the mind some times 
i think about how the image below the text could change based on what the text above it states 

they did not want to put you on a coding task 
you have been demoted 

little details 
i suppose the x could be a little lower down 
where are we in the life time of the story 
as i wish to go get some more to drink of the coffee substance
their this the desire to really work 
undistrubed but i know those days are all over now 
i have about one hour to type and then i must log in 
at least i will be paid in ten days 
a new amount 

the idea forming in the head deals with a character who does not want to leave her room 
so gets knocks on her door but sometimes she does not open them 

maybe she feels like all the creative power 
she can not even spell the work correctly 
she feels as if all the creative power she once had is gone 

she eats lots of candy 
and has a job cutting and pasting 
once she was a great programmer until a scandal occured 
her heart is damaged 
then simo beeing comes knocking at her door 
but she is upset about destroying her body 
if she invests in him he will provide her with the simo beeing 
all american alligator delivery system 

its a process where once recieves offers for alligator products because people really enjoy there alligator products 
and you need to go out into the wilderniss and take the item off the animal 

one product is a tooth 
to make a necklace 
that is what iona something wants to do 
she becomes camp indians 

yesterday i learned how they do it 
the great directors 

they break it down into locations 

studio apartment of iona something 
country store of clyde 

i feel pretty angry at my self this morning 
but if i can just do this one thing 
then that anger would disappear 

i am angry at myself because my body hurts 
my body hurts because i did something stupid 
i did something stupid and discovered 

barkay mckillikutti 
but i got nothing on this character except they are fierce

in fact the alligators are split into a few different types 
fierce 
strong
hard 
ravenous
quick 

but from here i can not tell you more 
and i drink down the last of my coffee 


locations
saurian sancuary 
the okeenokee snow swap 
country store of clyde 
lickskillet communitee art center 
beeing estate 
beetroit 

its all incredible stupid 
and then someting about bees 

and then there is astrly wylde 
the demensional space expolorer 

but i do not know how all these pieces work together 
espeically in a video game 

wanna be rich because i can not think of anything else to do 
what about turing your eyes toward jesus 

or learning more about politics 

so you have this amazing piece of tech at your fingertips 
that you can easily learn 
but i can not figure out what to do with it 
and my elbows hurt 
so i will just sit around thinking 
and drinking way too much 
caffine in the hopes so vision with come my way 

then there is the glopratchet 
which i admit i am not too terribly exicited to create 
but maybe i will after the canvas is printed off 

and then there is connected the input box with the back end box 

again not to excited 
and my tooth hurts 
and i consider giving up 
because nothing excites me 

please send it to me GOD

and then there is pain in my prost

i desire creative power 
to see things in my mind that inspire awe 
please give me a taste

and so i wait 
and let the mind wander while i try not to spend to much pressure on my elbow 

what do i see 
i see a ui 
and i know that i must connect with the father ship
soon

screens 
i see screens 
but screens of what 
so much creative power in the world 
way do i not feel like using it 



























and boy do i like working side here 
so what is next for me 
i suppose i need to start creating three d models 
but yeah i reall do not want too right now 


oh well so the asar packager did not work
i guess it boots up a little slower than i would like 
but not by much
see 

its all a total mess

here i think i can get this thing to load even faster 
you need the bottom bar to bee working 

there we go 
we have out cloud strummer device 

you will need to 


sigh and spin 
we will all it it begin
and that is all you need to do
ok here we go 
wrapping down our thoughts in own on custom 
thought creator 
expierence the feeling of not living up to the potential one believes they should be expierence at this current age of life 
well at least we have out own text editor 
the coffee cools beside us 
and we wanted to make a bargin with our self that we should not indulge 
we worship at the the altar of work 
what does that mean cxvxcv
what other alters exist 
and then you hear about the witness and the sin of envy glides over you 
but i do admit 
that i really really really do like this machine for capturing thought 
the glop ractchet

it has some issues
