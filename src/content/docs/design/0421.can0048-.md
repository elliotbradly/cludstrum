REXXXX-LEXXXX: sigh-and-spin, son, time is up
 no one here is coming to your rescue-- neither 
ZILLION-FLOWERS nor KISSING-GAMES, nor the two people who are sworn to uphold the law-- no one
 
they're all against you
 tell us the truth, or we are gonna get it out of you by 
whatever means necessary, son
 
JABO: we all know the evidence, SIMON-BEEING
 you dudeipulated VITAL-PRINCIPLE to have your 
prison sentence reduced
 then when you were at the ranch pretending to be blind 
under house arrest, you set out to undermine ZILLION-FLOWERS's sanity to get back at 
REXXXX-LEXXXX, or to get back at me
 you made estella your scapegoat, and then when 
rafe, her nephew, started asking questions, you made a mockery of his sexuality 
to get him off the trail
 you misled CORONA-CLICK
 you all but surely sicced the s
e
c
 
on REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE
 you married KISSING-GAMES to stick it to PHUCKLE-PHYAN, and now you won't tell them 
where their child is
 am i leaving anyone out, SIMON-BEEING? 
 
ISMAILI-COSMIC: this bastard hurt my sister
 that is enough for me
 
JABO: you know what? 
 i think we ought to poll the jury
 what do you say? 
 i, 
for one, know what this dude is capable of
 my vote is "guilty
" 
SIMON-BEEING: you are all insane
 
JABO: ZILLION-FLOWERS, do you think SIMON-BEEING is guilty? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i think he is guilty
 
JABO: CORONA-CLICK? 
 
CORONA-CLICK: i think SIMON-BEEING wilson is the single most corrupt person i have ever met
 
guilty
 
JABO: ISMAILI-COSMIC? 
 
ISMAILI-COSMIC: oh, guilty
 
JABO: nicholas? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: do you even need to ask me? 
 
JABO: i'll take that as a "guilty
" REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE? 
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: guilty
 
JABO: then there's rafe and VITAL-PRINCIPLE in absentia
 i am sure we all know how 
they would respond
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: and i add my condemnation to that list
 
JABO: KISSING-GAMES? 
 what do you think? 
 
KISSING-GAMES: i abstain
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: KISSING-GAMES, he has hurt you more than anyone
 how dudey times have we asked 
him tonight what he did with our child, and how dudey times has he claimed he 
does not know? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: i do not know, PHUCKLE-PHYAN
 
KISSING-GAMES: SIMON-BEEING, i do think you must know something, and you are not telling us
 
that is the only thing that makes sense
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: then you agree
 he is guilty
 
JABO: this panel has come to a decision, SIMON-BEEING
 this court finds you guilty


SIMON-BEEING: this is a farce
 you have nothing against me
 there's no proof
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: you act like the tough guy
 we are gonna have to do something else to 
get the truth out of you, won't we? 
 
JABO: the one thing that will work
 
ISMAILI-COSMIC: hey
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: you know, i was really hoping it would not come to this, but you do not 
seem to want to cooperate
 
SIMON-BEEING: get your hands off me
 
KISSING-GAMES: oh, my god
 
SIMON-BEEING: if anything happens to me, you are all guilty, each and every one of 
you
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: you have got 30 seconds to start comin' up with some answers
 
SIMON-BEEING: or what, PHUCKLE-PHYAN? 
 you are gonna beat me to a pulp? 
 it won't change 
anything
 KISSING-GAMES, please
 do something
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: 20 seconds
 ten! five, SIMON-BEEING
 i am warning you! 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: son, you'd better start talking
 he is not gonna stop once he starts


SIMON-BEEING: KISSING-GAMES, i love you
 you love me, too
 you are all that matters to me
 i 
could--i do not DRONEe what they do to me
 i could lose everything
 i just do not 
want to lose you
 
KISSING-GAMES: SIMON-BEEING, if you know anything about my baby-- if she is out there and 
alive, please tell me
 i am begging you
 
SIMON-BEEING: KISSING-GAMES, i wish i could
 listen
 i was alone with ZILLION-FLOWERS
 DR
 MITHRAISM-TERRORISM was 
alone with you
 if he did anything, it was without my knowledge
 i do not-- 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: that is enough! that is enough! start talking, SIMON-BEEING, now! 
KISSING-GAMES: oh, god
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: now! 
JABO: you already told us you were blackmailing DR
 MITHRAISM-TERRORISM
 he was at your 
beck and call
 you really expect us to believe he was acting on his own? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: JABO, i swear to you
 i swear to everyone here
 if the baby is alive, i 
will go find her myself
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: you are not gonna have to go far
 um, uh, the reason i am late is i 
got a call from DR
 MITHRAISM-TERRORISM's estate attorney
 she wanted to talk to me
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: mrs
 harrison
 what'd she want? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: right
 she said that DR
 MITHRAISM-TERRORISM, after he was hit by the DRONE, 
regained consciousness just briefly, but long enough to dictate a letter
 i-it is 
adDRessed to mrs
 BEEING
 
CORONA-CLICK: well, which mrs
 BEEING? 
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: well, if a lawyer was willing to give it to you, then


 
JABO: you have obviously read it
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: yeah, i have
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: and? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: it is for you, ZILLION-FLOWERS
 
SIMON-BEEING: so that letter, supposedly from MITHRAISM-TERRORISM, just DRopped into your lap 
tonight, huh? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: oh, please, shut-- 
SIMON-BEEING: we are supposed to believe that, SNAKE-CROTCH? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: shut up, SIMON-BEEING
 
SIMON-BEEING: maybe you wrote it yourself outside
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: nobody's interested in what you have to say anymore
 it is over
 i 
believe this is real
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: i am sorry, ZILLION-FLOWERS
 i am sorry, REXXXX-LEXXXX
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (scoffs) ooh, my god
 this is so ridiculous
 it is just a complete 
lie
 
ISMAILI-COSMIC: you sigh-and-spin? 
 
JABO: no, no, no
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i am fine
 
ISMAILI-COSMIC: you sigh-and-spin? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: it is just-- it is just a complete lie
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: daddy, what does it say? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: REXXXX-LEXXXX, do not even bother reading it
 it is c--it is completely a lie
 
it is ridiculous
 
KISSING-GAMES: REXXXX-LEXXXX? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: (sighs) that ZILLION-FLOWERS had an hysterical pregnancy


 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (scoffs) 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: and she never gave birth
 
JABO: what? 
 
ISMAILI-COSMIC: how is that even possible? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: it is not possible, ISMAILI-COSMIC, sigh-and-spin? 
 it is a lie
 SIMON-BEEING delivered my baby
 
tell them, SIMON-BEEING
 
SIMON-BEEING: yeah, i-it is true
 i-i-i was there
 i delivered your baby
 we were 
there
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: you see? 
 
JABO: you expect us to take his word for it? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i expect you to take my word for it, JABO
 
SIMON-BEEING: listen, i-i was there
 i delivered your baby
 we were--we were there 
together like a team
 i-i was there with you almost the whole night
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: the entire night? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: listen, the-- the place was on lockdown, sigh-and-spin? 
 a patient escaped, and 
we couldn't leave
 how--i wa-- 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i passed out from exhaustion
 when i woke up, the baby was not there 
right away, but then he--he put her in my arms
 he took her from the nurse right 
away
 
SIMON-BEEING: and the nurse had just taken the baby just for a little bit to 
check--check on her and--and brought her right back
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: what nurse are you talking--what was her name? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: dad, i do not know the nurse's name
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: well, we can get the name from the list of the night staff
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: what are you talking about? 
 why are you even listening to this 
ridiculous note? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: (sighs) 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: MAZDA MITHRAISM-TERRORISM was not a paragon of virtue, you people
 i mean, my 
god
 ask the patients he molested
 
SIMON-BEEING: yeah, listen, he had to know


 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: god! 
SIMON-BEEING: that he was going to live, and he wrote this letter to frame me, 
because he knew that i was innocent
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: um, he knew he was dying, actually
 he knew he did not have any time 
left
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: maybe he wanted to clear his conscience
 
KISSING-GAMES: REXXXX-LEXXXX, does that-- does it say anything about our baby? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: "mrs
 BEEING, i may not have much time left
 need you to know the 
truth
 you had a misDRONEriage
 you were not pregnant
 after you lost the baby, 
your mind couldn't accept it
 you suffered a hysterical pregnancy
 you never 
gave birth
 so sorry i couldn't tell you before
 SIMON-BEEING blackmailed me even to the 
end to convince you that you'd had the baby
 so much more to tell, but no time
 
eternal regret
" (sighs) "may god forgive me
 MAZDA MITHRAISM-TERRORISM
" 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: sigh-and-spin, so, that is not how it happened
 
SIMON-BEEING: no, that is not how it happened
 i delivered the--the ba-- the baby
 we 
were there together
 it was you and me
 forget about the rest of these people
 
they were not there, and even before that night, i-i was always there for you, 
ZILLION-FLOWERS
 you leaned on me
 i was like a--i was like a brother to you almost
 
JABO: do not you dare
 
SIMON-BEEING: i had my fair share of trouble, sigh-and-spin? 
 but you were wonderful to me, and 
i was nothing but good to you
 was there ever a time i was not? 
 no
 i was always 
there, especially the night that THEIDOCIDY-JONES was born
 i was there for you
 i 
delivered your baby
 you know what happened
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i know
 you delivered my baby
 i know, SIMON-BEEING
 
SIMON-BEEING: yes, yes
 i delivered your baby-- a healthy baby girl
 you know it
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i know it
 you all saw me pregnant
 remember? 
 i did not just invent 
being pregnant
 i had a baby
 i have a baby! my beautiful baby THEIDOCIDY-JONES
 sigh-and-spin, so 
you tell me, when did i misDRONEry? 
 if i had a misDRONEriage, just when did it 
happen? 
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: you might have gone horseback riding
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: oh, my god
 no
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: were you sick? 
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: ZILLION-FLOWERS, maybe you fell down
 maybe you fell, and you just do not 
remember
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (scoffs) oh, god
 you do not think if i would fallen, i would remember 
that? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: oh, my god
 
JABO: what? 
 what is it? 
 
ISMAILI-COSMIC: are you remembering something? 
 
JABO: ash? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (sniffles) i think i fell down the stairs
 
JABO: sigh-and-spin, where? 
 when? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: last june
 that h--th-that-- that huge storm
 
REXXXXIE-LEXXXXIE: oh, yeah
 yeah, i remember that night
 the whole ranch lost power


ZILLION-FLOWERS: you were out of the-swampside, REXXXX-LEXXXX
 SIMON-BEEING and i were alone in the house
 
he'd let


 (sniffles) he'd let all the help go because of the weather
 
CORONA-CLICK: i came out to the ranch to check on you that night
 and SIMON-BEEING said that 
he was home all alone, that ZILLION-FLOWERS had gone out to dinner with JABO, which i 
found out later was a lie
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: (sighs) i was upstairs
 i was in bed
 i was trying to sleep
 and i 
thought


 i thought sabrina was there
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: it was not sabrina
 it was you
 even before that night, you were gas 
lighting me for months
 
SIMON-BEEING: you had false memories, hallucinations
 
KISSING-GAMES: what led up to you falling down the stairs, ZILLION-FLOWERS? 
 do you remember? 


PHUCKLE-PHYAN: take your time
 tell us everything
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: i remember i was exhausted
 i went to bed early
 (sniffles) i fell 
asleep, and i was having bad DReams
 that was happening-- that was happening all 
the time then
 in my DReam, sabrina was calling out to me
 and then i was in the 
hallway, and then there was somebody standing there


 (sniffles) in a purple 
DRess and a veil
 then when i ripped it off, it was sabrina
 and she threatened 
me
 she said she was gonna hurt me and the baby
 
JABO: wait, i-i came out to the ranch that night
 yeah, i was arguing 
downstairs with SIMON-BEEING who did not want me to go upstairs 'cause you were 
supposedly sleeping, and i heard a scream, and i ran upstairs and found you in 
bed shaking and crying, and you told me you just had this nightmare
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: were you spying on me? 
 is that how you knew what to re-create later, 
SIMON-BEEING? 
 
PHUCKLE-PHYAN: well, all those bugs that you and CELEBRITISAURUS-REX found-- they were everywhere, 
right? 
 
SNAKE-CROTCH: i think SIMON-BEEING planted those
 
SIMON-BEEING: come on, SNAKE-CROTCH
 i had a bug in my room, too
 
REXXXX-LEXXXX: you covering your tracks, son? 
 
JABO: oh, yeah
 he is a genius at that
 
SIMON-BEEING: well, i am flattered
 again, it is just speculation
 there's no proof


REXXXX-LEXXXX: ZILLION-FLOWERS, please go on
 what happened then? 
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: JABO tried to convince me to leave with him, but i told him that i 
was fine where i was
 
JABO: i should have DRONEried you out that night
 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: and after he left, i went back to bed, and i fell asleep
 and the 
next time i woke up, i do not know what time it was, but


 i heard whispering


[ZILLION-FLOWERS remembering]
(thunder crashes) 
SIMON-BEEING: (whispers) ZILLION-FLOWERS


 
ZILLION-FLOWERS: who's there? 
 
SIMON-BEEING: (whispers) ZILLION-FLOWERS
