**Game Design Document: "The Ministry of Aesthetic Correction"**

**Logline:** As a "deviant" artist in the state-run Ministry, you must create art in your cell-studio (the idle game). You then face two alternating, high-stakes trials (the roguelike runs): the insidious social stealth of the "Exhibition Night" to curry favor with cultural elites, and the brutal psychological torment of the "Corrective Review" before the Ministry's authoritarian board. Your goal is to navigate this vicious cycle of critique and compliance to earn the Ministry's ultimate, surreal prize: a chaperoned trip to Disney World with the ghosts of your family.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**

This design features a central idle game ("The Studio Cell") that feeds into two distinct, alternating roguelike runs, creating a complex cycle of risk and reward.

1.  **The Idle Game (The Studio Cell):**
    *   **Mechanics:** A hybrid of both studio concepts. You are given meager "Authorized Pigment Rations" by the Ministry but can find "Contraband Memories" to refine into vibrant, illegal "Subversive Pigments."
    *   **The Canvas & The Mandate:** You must create "Pieces" to fulfill state "Mandates." Using subversive pigments increases the Piece's "Artistic Soul" but also your "Deviation" meter, risking a **Corrective Review.** Using only authorized pigments keeps you safe but creates soulless art.
    *   **The Goal:** To craft a "Piece" of art. Its composition (the pigments used) determines your abilities for the next roguelike run.

2.  **The Roguelike Runs (Alternating Trials):**
    *   **The Exhibition Night (The Light):** After completing a Piece, you can *choose* to exhibit it. This is a social stealth run in a glittering, high-society gallery.
        *   **Goal:** Schmooze patrons and critics to earn "Influence" and "Financial Backing"—rare resources that can be smuggled back to your cell to bribe guards for better pigments or tools.
        *   **Gameplay:** Your abilities are your "Artist's Statements," tied to your art's pigments. Success brings great rewards, but failure (being exposed as a fraud or a political dissident) results in public humiliation and a "Scathing Review" debuff for your idle game.
    *   **The Corrective Review (The Darkness):** If your "Deviation" meter maxes out in the studio, you are *forced* into this run.
        *   **Goal:** Survive a brutal interrogation by the Ministry's Authoritarian board.
        *   **Gameplay:** A hostile, turn-based dialogue battle where you defend your art and soul. Success is merely survival. Failure results in "Re-Education," stripping you of resources and inflicting massive "Humiliation."

**The Endgame Path to Disney World:**

The entire system is governed by **Civic Merit Points (CMP)**.

*   **Compliance:** Excelling at "Corrective Reviews" by creating soulless art and providing meek answers earns you CMP.
*   **Subversive Success:** Excelling at "Exhibition Nights" with powerful, soulful art earns you "Influence," which can be secretly traded on a black market for a small amount of "forged" CMP.

This creates the ultimate dilemma: Do you play the Ministry's game, or do you play the fickle, dangerous game of the elite art world? Both paths are treacherous, but both can lead, step by painful step, to the astronomical CMP cost of the **"Familial Rehabilitation Excursion."** The final run remains the surreal, chaperoned trip to Disney World, a harrowing performance of happiness where your ultimate victory is not freedom, but a fleeting, manufactured memory with the ghosts you fought so hard to remember.


Of course. Let's undertake this ambitious synthesis. We will forge a singular, cohesive design document that merges the intimate, market-driven horror of "The Studio" with the brutalist, state-sponsored terror of "Cell Block C." This fusion will create a richer, more complex world where the artist is trapped not by one system, but by the suffocating interplay of two. The extremes of light and darkness will be amplified, and the path to the surreal "Disney World" endgame will be the central, agonizing thread weaving through it all.

**Game Design Document: "Anhedonia: A Retrospective"**

**Logline:** You are a Designated Artist living in the state-controlled "Artistic Sector," a place that is both a high-end gallery district and a gilded cage. In your state-allotted studio (the idle game), you must process your contraband memories into Art. This Art is then subjected to two terrifying trials: the fickle, market-driven humiliation of the "Exhibition Night" and the brutal, ideological judgment of the Ministry's "Corrective Review" (the roguelike runs). Caught between the predatory whims of capital and the iron fist of the state, your only hope for escape is the Ministry's ultimate prize: a "Rehabilitative Excursion" to Disney World with the ghosts of your family.

**Core Metaphor:** You are not just a prisoner of the state; you are also a prisoner of the market. Your soul is a commodity to be bought, sold, critiqued, and "corrected." The "light" of commercial success is just as blinding and dangerous as the darkness of authoritarian punishment. True freedom lies somewhere beyond both.

### **I. The Core Gameplay Loop: The Two-Front War**

The player's journey is a continuous cycle of creation and judgment, fighting a war on two fronts.

1.  **Creation (The Idle Phase):** In your Studio/Cell, you create "Pieces" of Art.
2.  **Judgment (The Roguelike Phase):** Upon completing a Piece, you are *forced* to subject it to one of two alternating roguelike runs:
    *   **Run Type A: The Exhibition Night:** A public gallery opening to appease the Patrons and the Market.
    *   **Run Type B: The Corrective Review:** A private tribunal to satisfy the Ministry and the State.
3.  **Consequence (The Metaprogression):** The outcomes of these runs dictate your resources, your psychological state, and your progress towards the surreal endgame.

### **II. The Idle Phase: "The Studio-Cell" - A Space of Contradiction**

This is the heart of the game, a place that is both a sterile Ministry cell and a chic, minimalist artist's studio. The UI and descriptive text reflect this duality—the concrete walls are also "pristine white gallery surfaces," the single barred window also offers a "curated view of the Sector."

**A. The Duality of Creation (Idle Mechanics):**

*   **Core Resources:**
    *   **"Authorized Rations" (Pigments, Clay, etc.):** A meager, daily allotment of drab, soulless materials from the Ministry. Used to create "Conformist Art."
    *   **"Contraband Memories":** Found through risky idle actions (`[Listen at the Walls]`, `[Bribe a Custodian]`). These are your true, vibrant, and illegal emotional resources.
*   **The Canvas/Mandate:** You work on a central "Piece." It always begins with a **Ministry Mandate** ("Tribute to the Sector's Prosperity"). Your core choice is how to fulfill it.
    *   **Path of Compliance:** Use only Authorized Rations. This is safe, quick, and generates **"Civic Merit Points" (CMP)**, the state currency.
    *   **Path of Subversion:** Secretly mix in refined `Contraband Memories` to turn them into vibrant, **"Subversive Pigments."** This creates "Art with Soul," but generates the dangerous **"Deviation"** resource.
*   **New Mechanic: "Market Buzz" & "Studio Prestige":**
    *   In addition to the Ministry's `Deviation` meter, a second, parallel pressure system exists: **"Market Buzz."** This is an idle resource that represents your reputation among the Sector's wealthy elite.
    *   `Market Buzz` is generated by `[Leaking Rumors of Your Next Piece]` or by spending a new resource, `Validation`, earned from successful Exhibition Nights.
    *   **Studio Prestige:** High `Market Buzz` upgrades your studio. The concrete floor might become "polished terrazzo." A better easel is "delivered." These upgrades boost production. However, high Prestige also attracts more dangerous, high-profile Critics to your Exhibitions, making those runs harder. This creates a feedback loop: success breeds greater challenges.

**B. The Light and the Dark (Amplified Extremes):**

*   **The Light (Moments of "Flow"):** Successfully using a rare `Contraband Memory of Joy` can trigger a "Flow State." For a short time, your studio is filled with warm, beautiful light. All production is massively boosted. The Warden-Curator's intercom is silent. These are fleeting, precious moments of pure creative bliss—the "light" in the game's design.
*   **The Darkness ("Psychic Contamination"):** Failing a run badly or indulging in a "Vice" can cause **"Psychic Contamination."** Your studio becomes dark and nightmarish. The shadows seem to move. Contraband Memories can rot and turn into `Corrupted Remnants`, which, if used, create monstrous, high-Deviation art that is almost impossible to defend. This is the "darkness," a state of creative horror and despair.

### **III. The Roguelike Phase A: "The Exhibition Night" - Trial by Capital**

This run is a spectacle of social horror, a performance for the predatory elite of the Artistic Sector.

*   **The Venue:** A lavish, procedurally generated gallery space, dripping with wealth and false sophistication. The lighting is bright and warm, but feels just as interrogative as the Ministry's spotlight.
*   **The Goal:** Impress Patrons to earn **"Validation"** (the market currency) and increase your `Market Buzz` without having your `Composure` shattered by Critics and Rivals.
*   **Mechanics ("The Palette" & "Aura of the Art"):**
    *   As in the "Studio" design, your abilities ("Artist's Statements") are drawn from the Pigments used in the exhibited Piece. Subversive Pigments grant you powerful but risky statements (`[Unflinching Emotional Honesty]`), while Conformist Pigments grant safe but weak ones (`[A Platitude About Aethetic Harmony]`).
    *   The "Aura of the Art" mechanic returns, creating a tactical element around your displayed work.
*   **The Authoritarian Threat (Market-Driven):** The "Authoritarian" here is not a single person but **"The Consensus."** A meter tracks the collective mood of the room. If your art is too challenging or you are too awkward, the Consensus turns against you. Patrons get bored, Critics smell blood, and the entire room becomes hostile.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   **Success:** You are awarded `Validation` and a massive boost to `Market Buzz`. You might even attract a "Private Collector," unlocking a powerful permanent studio upgrade.
    *   **Failure:** A humiliating social collapse. Your `Humiliation` stat skyrockets, `Market Buzz` plummets, and you return to your studio in a state of "Psychic Contamination."

---

### **IV. The Roguelike Phase B: "The Corrective Review" - Trial by State**

Alternating with the Exhibitions, this run is a cold, brutalist nightmare of ideological judgment.

*   **The Venue:** The stark, amphitheater-like interrogation room of the Ministry. The air is cold. The only sound is the hum of fluorescent lights.
*   **The Goal:** Survive the interrogation of the **Authoritarian Inquisitors** without your `Resolve` being broken.
*   **Mechanics (Dialogue as Combat & The Verdict):**
    *   This plays out as described in the "Ministry" design. You defend your art and yourself against accusations, using "Artist's Statements" derived from your Pigments.
    *   The run ends with a **"Verdict"** that awards or penalizes your **"Civic Merit Points" (CMP)** and can bestow permanent "Scars" or rare "Sparks of Rebellion."
*   **New Synergy - The Market's Shadow:** Your performance in the Exhibition Night now affects the Corrective Review. If you were a massive commercial success, the Ministry might be more lenient, seeing you as a valuable asset ("Verdict: 'Commercially Viable Deviance' - a slap on the wrist"). Conversely, if you were a commercial failure, they will come down on you harder, seeing you as useless as well as subversive.

### **V. The Synthesis: An Unwinnable Game & The Vices**

The player is trapped between two opposing value systems.

*   **The Central Conflict:** The art that pleases the Market (emotional, raw, subversive) is precisely what angers the Ministry. The art that satisfies the Ministry (conformist, soulless) is ridiculed at Exhibitions.
*   **It's a balancing act.** The player must learn to create "hybrid" pieces—art that is just conformist enough to pass a Review, but with just enough "Soul" to impress a Patron. This is the core strategic challenge of the idle game.

**The Vices (The Two Forms of "Selling Out"):**

The player has two "Panic Buttons," each catering to one of the two systems.

1.  **The Market Vice: `[Sign with a Gallery Agent]`**
    *   **Action:** You trade your artistic freedom for security. The Agent will handle the Ministry, using their influence to lower your `Deviation` and protect you from Corrective Reviews for a time.
    *   **Cost:** You lose control over your art. The Agent now dictates your "Mandates," forcing you to mass-produce whatever is commercially popular. You gain massive `Validation` but your ability to find `Contraband Memories` withers. You have sold your soul to the market.
2.  **The State Vice: `[Request a Voluntary Confession]`**
    *   **Action:** You turn yourself over to the Ministry Psycho-Analyst. You sell your `Contraband Memories` directly for a huge sum of **Civic Merit Points (CMP)**.
    *   **Cost:** You betray your own past. The `Family Photograph` on your desk fades catastrophically. You are safe from the whims of the market, but you have become a willing instrument of the state.

### **VI. The Endgame: The Path to Disney World - A Manufactured Paradise**

The ultimate goal remains. The only way to "win" and escape the Sector is to purchase the **`[Familial Rehabilitation Excursion]`** from the Ministry's Merit Store. This requires an almost impossible amount of CMP.

**The Journey to the Happiest Place on Earth:**

*   **The Prerequisite:** To even afford the trip, a player must master the art of playing both sides. They need the "Sparks of Rebellion" from defiant Reviews to make art good enough to generate `Validation` at Exhibitions. They need that `Validation` to buy influence that protects them from the Ministry. They need to be a successful commodity *and* a model citizen. It's a tightrope walk over an abyss.
*   **The Final Run:** The "Day Trip" to Disney World is the game's final, unique roguelike run. It is the ultimate synthesis of both threats.
    *   **The Duality of Judgment:** You are accompanied by both the cheerful **Ministry Rehabilitation Officer** (judging your ideological joy) AND a slick, cynical **Art Critic** from the Sector (judging the "authenticity" of your family experience for a potential future article). You are being watched and judged from both sides simultaneously.
    *   **The "Family" Apparitions:** Their clarity is determined by how much of your soul you have left—how much you *didn't* sell to either the State or the Market.
    *   **The Gameplay:** A series of vignettes where you must simultaneously perform ideological happiness for the Officer and authentic emotional connection for the Critic. It is an impossible task. A sincere laugh might please the Critic but seem "insufficiently grateful" to the Officer. A state-approved smile might satisfy the Officer but read as "inauthentic" to the Critic.

**The Endings (Amplified Light and Darkness):**

*   **The Darkness (The Compliance Ending):** You somehow manage to please both your wardens. You return to the Sector. You are hailed as the ultimate success story: an artist who is both critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and ideally patriotic. You are the Ministry's greatest triumph. Your studio is now a luxurious penthouse, but it is also the most secure cell of all. The family photograph is gone, replaced by a framed, glowing review. You are completely and utterly trapped in your success. This is the "dark" ending masquerading as light.
*   **The Light (The Secret "Truth" Ending):** To achieve this, you must have walked the tightrope perfectly, preserving your rebellious spirit AND your market savvy, and enter Disney World with a crystal-clear Photograph. At the climax of the trip, you are presented with a final choice by the Critic and the Officer: `[Sign the Exclusive Tell-All]` or `[Sign the Final Confession]`.
    *   You are given a third, hidden option, unlocked by your journey: `[Create One Last Piece]`.
    *   You select it. The world freezes. You use the raw, emotional energy of the moment—the fake joy, the real sorrow, the ghostly presence of your family—to craft an "Invisible Masterpiece" in your mind.
    *   This act of pure, un-commodified, un-judged creation is so powerful it shatters the simulation. The Critic, the Officer, Disney World, the Ministry—it all dissolves into light and static.
    *   You awaken in a simple, quiet room. There is a plain wooden door. It is unlocked. You have achieved "Silence" and with it, freedom. This is the true "light"—not a reward given by the system, but a reality seized by breaking it entirely.
