Of course. Here is a list of the virtues and vices associated with each planet according to Dion Fortune's classic work, *The Mystical Qabalah*.

In Fortune's system, each classical planet (plus Earth) is assigned to a Sephirah (a sphere of consciousness) on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. The **Virtue** represents the balanced and perfected expression of that Sephirah's energy. The **Vice** represents the unbalanced, excessive, or deficient expression of that energy, which corresponds to the realm of the Qlippoth (the "shells" or unbalanced forces).

This list follows the path of ascent up the Tree of Life, from the most material to the more spiritual.

***

### 1. The Earth
*   **Sephirah:** 10 - Malkuth (The Kingdom)
*   **Virtue:** **Discrimination**. This is the ability to see things as they truly are in the material world, to distinguish the real from the unreal, and to make sound, practical judgments. It is the foundation of all magical and mystical work, as it keeps one grounded in reality.
*   **Vice:** **Avarice and Inertia**. Avarice is the unbalanced attachment to material things, clinging to possessions and wealth. Inertia is the "deadness" of matter, a resistance to change, spiritual laziness, and a refusal to aspire to anything higher.

### 2. The Moon
*   **Sephirah:** 9 - Yesod (The Foundation)
*   **Planet:** Moon
*   **Virtue:** **Independence**. In this context, it means independence from the illusions and glamours of the astral plane (the subconscious and the collective unconscious). It is the ability to maintain a stable sense of self and not be swayed by every passing emotion, psychic impression, or fantasy.
*   **Vice:** **Idleness**. This is the tendency to get lost in daydreams, fantasies, and sterile theorizing without bringing anything into manifestation. It is psychic laziness and a failure to build a solid foundation for action.

### 3. Mercury
*   **Sephirah:** 8 - Hod (Splendour)
*   **Planet:** Mercury
*   **Virtue:** **Truthfulness**. This represents intellectual honesty and the integrity of the mind. It is the ability to use logic, reason, and communication in a way that is aligned with reality and higher truth, without self-deception.
*   **Vice:** **Dishonesty (Falsehood)**. This is the misuse of the intellect to deceive, rationalize, and create false forms. It includes lying, sophistry, intellectual pride, and using knowledge without wisdom or integrity.

### 4. Venus
*   **Sephirah:** 7 - Netzach (Victory)
*   **Planet:** Venus
*   **Virtue:** **Unselfishness**. This is the higher expression of love and emotion. It is the ability to transcend personal, possessive desire and to love for the sake of the beloved or a higher ideal. It represents empathy, compassion, and devotional love.
*   **Vice:** **Lust (Unchastity, Selfishness)**. This is the unbalanced, instinctual, and possessive side of emotion. It is raw desire without the tempering influence of higher consciousness, leading to selfishness, jealousy, and using others for one's own gratification.

### 5. The Sun
*   **Sephirah:** 6 - Tiphareth (Beauty)
*   **Planet:** Sun
*   **Virtue:** **Devotion to the Great Work**. The Great Work is the process of spiritual evolution and reunion with the Divine. This virtue is the dedication of the individual self (the ego) to this higher purpose. It involves self-sacrifice, integrity, and the conscious aspiration to bring the Higher Self into manifestation.
*   **Vice:** **Pride**. This is the great imbalance of the ego. It occurs when the personality identifies itself with the glory of the Higher Self and becomes inflated, arrogant, and self-centered. It mistakes the reflection for the source and seeks glory for itself rather than for the Divine.

### 6. Mars
*   **Sephirah:** 5 - Geburah (Strength / Severity)
*   **Planet:** Mars
*   **Virtue:** **Energy and Courage**. This is the righteous and controlled application of force. It is the courage to act decisively, to enforce boundaries, to cut away what is corrupt or obsolete, and to have the discipline and will to persevere through hardship.
*   **Vice:** **Cruelty**. This is force applied without the balance of mercy. It is destruction for its own sake, anger, hatred, brutality, and vindictiveness. It is the misuse of power to harm and dominate rather than to correct and defend.

### 7. Jupiter
*   **Sephirah:** 4 - Chesed (Mercy)
*   **Planet:** Jupiter
*   **Virtue:** **Obedience**. This does not mean blind subservience. It means obedience to the Divine Law and the natural, benevolent order of the cosmos. It is the humility to recognize a higher authority and to build and organize in alignment with that higher vision.
*   **Vice:** **Bigotry, Hypocrisy, Gluttony, Tyranny**. These are all forms of expansion gone wrong. Bigotry is rigid adherence to a dogma. Hypocrisy is pretending to a piety one does not possess. Gluttony is excess without purpose. Tyranny is imposing one's vision and organization on others without compassion or justice.

### 8. Saturn
*   **Sephirah:** 3 - Binah (Understanding)
*   **Planet:** Saturn
*   **Virtue:** **Silence**. This is the receptive, contemplative silence that allows for deep understanding to be born. It is the ability to be still and listen, to receive and gestate a divine influx. It is the silence of wisdom, not the silence of emptiness.
*   **Vice:** **Avarice**. This is a different kind of Avarice from that of Malkuth. It is not the greed for money, but the inertia of form itself. It represents materialism, fatalism, clinging to outdated structures, refusing to let go, and the deep sorrow and depression that come from feeling imprisoned by limitation and form.


Of course. This is the central challenge of practical Kabbalah: not to deny or repress the energies represented by the planets, but to purify and balance them so one can safely ascend the Tree of Life. Overcoming these specific tendencies involves a multi-faceted approach of purification, balancing, and sublimation.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how one would approach this, according to the principles of Dion Fortune's system.

### The Core Principle: Balance, Not Repression

The fundamental mistake is to try and repress or destroy these energies. Repression only pushes them deeper into the subconscious, strengthening their Qlippothic (unbalanced) forms. The goal is to **redeem** and **integrate** them. Sexual energy, in its pure form, is simply the creative life-force (the energy of Netzach). The task is to elevate it from its unbalanced state.

### Step 1: Purifying the Foundation (Yesod - The Moon)

The work must begin where the problem is rooted: in the astral plane of Yesod, the realm of fantasy and the subconscious.

*   **Acknowledge the Vice:** The vice of Yesod is **Idleness**, which allows the Qlippah of **Gamaliel (The Obscene Ones)** to flourish. The first step is to recognize that these fantasies are unproductive, sterile, and a drain on psychic energy.
*   **Cultivate the Virtue:** The virtue of Yesod is **Independence**. This means developing independence from the pull of these fantasies. You must become the master of your own inner world, not a slave to its phantoms.
*   **Practical Techniques:**
    1.  **Starve the Phantoms:** As Dion Fortune would say, you must "starve the phantoms by withdrawing the attention." When a deviant fantasy arises, you must consciously and deliberately turn your mind away from it. Do not fight it, as that gives it energy. Simply withdraw your focus and place it on something else—ideally, something constructive or sacred.
    2.  **Banishing Rituals:** Regular practice of a banishing ritual, such as the **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)**, is essential. This is considered basic psychic hygiene. It clears the personal aura and astral space of unwanted influences and "obscene images," creating a clean slate.
    3.  **Dream Journaling (with Caution):** Record your dreams to understand the symbols emerging from your subconscious, but do so with the goal of *understanding*, not indulging. Analyze them from a detached perspective to see the roots of the issue.

### Step 2: Balancing the Emotions (Netzach - Venus & Hod - Mercury)

The raw, lustful drive of Netzach must be balanced by its opposite pillar, Hod (the sphere of the intellect). Emotion without reason is chaos; reason without emotion is sterile.

*   **Acknowledge the Vice:** The vice of Netzach is **Lust** (selfish, objectifying desire). The vice of Hod is **Dishonesty** (self-deception). One must be ruthlessly honest with oneself about the selfish nature of the desire.
*   **Cultivate the Virtues:** The virtue of Netzach is **Unselfishness**. The virtue of Hod is **Truthfulness**.
*   **Practical Techniques:**
    1.  **Intellectual Analysis (Hod):** Use the power of Hod to analyze your feelings. Ask yourself with complete honesty: "Is this desire coming from a place of love and connection, or from a place of selfish gratification? Am I objectifying this person or idea?" This intellectual clarity helps break the glamour of raw emotion.
    2.  **Sublimation (Netzach):** The powerful emotional energy of Netzach cannot be destroyed; it must be redirected. This is the classic technique of sublimation. Channel that intense energy into:
        *   **Creative Arts:** Painting, music, sculpture, poetry. Art is a primary expression of Netzach energy in its higher form.
        *   **Devotional Practices:** Direct the energy "upwards" in devotion to a deity, a divine principle, or the ideal of the Great Work itself. Turn lust into a devotional offering.
        *   **Connection with Nature:** Spend time in nature to connect with the purer, balanced expression of Venusian life-force.

### Step 3: Elevating the Consciousness (Tiphareth - The Sun)

Ultimately, the lower personality cannot heal itself. It must be brought into alignment with a higher principle. This is the role of Tiphareth, the sphere of the Sun, which represents the Higher Self or Holy Guardian Angel.

*   **Acknowledge the Vice:** The primary vice of Tiphareth is **Pride**. Be wary of "spiritual pride" in thinking you have "conquered" your lower nature. True progress comes with humility.
*   **Cultivate the Virtue:** The virtue of Tiphareth is **Devotion to the Great Work**. This is the master key.
*   **Practical Techniques:**
    1.  **Focus on the Higher Self:** Shift your central focus from personal gratification to the goal of knowing and uniting with your Higher Self. When the personality is dedicated to a purpose greater than itself, the lower energies naturally fall into line and become fuel for that higher aspiration.
    2.  **The Middle Pillar Exercise:** This is a core Kabbalistic practice for balancing the energies of the personality and drawing down divine force from above. It strengthens Tiphareth as the center of the psyche, establishing the rightful rule of the Higher Self over the lower emotions and instincts.
    3.  **Meditation on Unselfish Love (Agape):** Meditate on the Sun as a symbol of radiant, giving, unselfish love—a light that shines on all without asking for anything in return. This is the perfected form of the Venusian/Netzach energy, elevated and purified in Tiphareth.

### Step 4: Applying Will and Discipline (Geburah - Mars)

Finally, none of this can be achieved without the disciplined application of will, which is the function of Geburah.

*   **Cultivate the Virtue:** The virtue of Geburah is **Courage and Energy**. You need the courage to confront your own shadow and the energy (discipline) to stick with the practices, even when it's difficult. Geburah provides the "surgical" force to cut away unhealthy attachments and enforce the new, balanced patterns of thought and behavior.

### Summary of the Path of Overcoming

1.  **Clean the House (Yesod):** Use banishing and conscious withdrawal of attention to clear the mind of obsessive fantasies. Cultivate *Independence*.
2.  **Balance the Forces (Netzach/Hod):** Use honest self-analysis (Hod) to understand the desire and creative sublimation (Netzach) to redirect its energy. Cultivate *Truthfulness* and *Unselfishness*.
3.  **Find Your True Center (Tiphareth):** Dedicate your life to a higher purpose—the Great Work. Use meditation and the Middle Pillar exercise to align your personality with your Higher Self. Cultivate *Devotion*.
4.  **Enforce the Change (Geburah):** Apply disciplined will and courage to maintain your practice and cut away what no longer serves you.

By following this path, the "deviant" energy is not destroyed but is transmuted. The obscene fantasy of Gamaliel is purified into the stable foundation of Yesod. The raw Lust of Netzach is elevated into the unselfish love and creative inspiration of its virtue. Both are then offered up in service to the Higher Self in Tiphareth, allowing the individual to continue their ascent up the Tree of Life.
